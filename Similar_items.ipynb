Dad acquired some starter in about 1959 that its guardian said had been going since the days of the 49ers. I know it's been bubbling since then. All Dad made, though, were bread and rubbery pancakes. He, unfortunately, didn't buy a copy for himself, although I'd give anything to have him make another meal of them! You see, that's the magic of sourdough, the romance, the stories, the memories! I've not yet been to Alaska, but Ruth Allman has taken me from Cheechako to Sourdough by generously sharing her recipes and her stories with me. I read this book just for the enjoyment of it sometimes. We had her waffles this morning. I made her Flower Rolls recipe into Danish rolls for my famously fussy father-in-law. What better tribute could I make to this cook and her book than to say that he loved them! My two year old son and I will make a little fire in the woods and bake a sourdough version of bannock in Dad's old Dutch oven this week and make some memories of our own.|\n",

reviews on here they range from 4 to 5 stars with an ocassional bad review thrown into the mix go figure i cant offer much more than whats alreaddy been said but what i will offer is from the perspective of a 27 year old guy for starters dont even kid yourself into thinking this is for women only its not and you dont have to be a new age sensetive guy either to enjoy the full spectrum of emotions this book will put you through at times i laffed out loud so hard i thought my belly would burst open and at other times i would find myself crying and the tears would stream down my face so much that my eyes would sting and burn so that i would have to wait a few mintues to begin readding again this book was a rollor coaster ride for me it just so happened that i stumbled upon this book while my sister was cleaning out her closet i figured i de give it a read and never imagined in a million years that it would have such an effect on me once i got through the first 50 or so pages i jus couldnt put it down and when i was through i was sad it was over maybe johnny nolan reminded me of my own father the not so educated but oh so handsome drunk or maybe katie nolan the hard work n practical mother of francie and neely nolan reminded me of my own mother all i can say is if u get the chance please do yourself a favor and take the oppertunity to read this book men esspecially cause this is definetly not 4 women only

Bilbo Baggin's long, enthralling, and extreme adventure with the great wizard, Gandolf, and his thirteen dwarves, will make you want to read more and more. You might even finish the book in a day or two. As Gandolf and the dwarves persuade him to come with him to fight the evil dragon, Smog, and take back the gold that was once all of theirs, they are about to encounter the most exiting part of their lives.Every page of this book is a dose of excitement and action. The great part about the book is that the rising action keeps building and building drastically until the end. The Hobbit is a must read for all fantasy lovers. But even if you aren't a fantasy lover, you will still marvel this amazing book.By Will

It is a vivid and lucid reconstruction of a long forgotten era.It is the first volume of a powerful series.The story is as follows; Ayla is Cro-Magnon orphaned by an earthquake and adopted by a Neanderthal female, from this point on, a strange world unfold.It's a discovery trip for Ayla and the reader. At the same time allows us a deep insight into \"otherness\".There are forceful descriptions of Ice Age habitat and Neanderthal culture, looking into stone technology, herb doctor techniques, hunting methods, weaponry, social relationships and whatever aspect of a civilization you may be interested it is shown.In a present world that is shrinking and cultural differences arise every minute, Ms Auel's work show the human common traits that make us kin to every other human being, even if it is as distantly related as a Neanderthal.Don't miss this experience!Reviewed by Max Yofre.

Lee was one of two Tolkien illustrators called by Peter Jackson for the making of the trilogy film, The Lord of the Rings. His brilliance shines through in the recreation of Rivendell and the warm feel of Hobbiton. As a life-long fan of the Lord of the Rings, I have never been disappointed by Lee's interpretation of a scene or character. His artistic skill hits the mark dead center every time on every concept. In fact, this is one artist of a few (if not the only one) who are officially recognized by Tolkien's estate as a bard of Middle Earth. Therefore, the illustrations in this beautiful edition of a great book by the 20th century's best author are bound to appeal to you as you read it. In this book, the arguing trolls are just as I've imagined them, and the dwarves are like real people, not plump bodies with noses the size of their heads. The eagles, too, are glorious. I heartily recommend this edition of Tolkien's wonderful fantasy!

                               |A2ORLF4C88HDUJ|Whereas other reviews have focused on Tolkien's excellent story, I want to recommend Alan Lee's fantastic illustrations. Lee was one of two Tolkien illustrators called by Peter Jackson for the making of the trilogy film, The Lord of the Rings. His brilliance shines through in the recreation of Rivendell and the warm feel of Hobbiton. As a life-long fan of the Lord of the Rings, I have never been disappointed by Lee's interpretation of a scene or character. His artistic skill hits the mark dead center every time on every concept. In fact, his is one artist of a few (if not the only one) who are officially recognized by Tolkien's estate as a bard of Middle Earth. Therefore, the illustrations in this beautiful edition of a great book by the 20th century's best author are bound to appeal to you as you read it. In this book, the arguing trolls are just as I've imagined them, and the dwarves are like real people, not plump bodies with noses the size of their heads. The eagles, too, are glorious. I heartily recommend this edition of Tolkien's wonderful fantasy!

recommend alan lee s fantastic illustrations lee was one of two tolkien illustrators called by peter jackson for the making of the trilogy film the lord of the rings his brilliance shines through in the recreation of rivendell and the warm feel of hobbiton as a life long fan of the lord of the rings i have never been disappointed by lee s interpretation of a scene or character his artistic skill hits the mark dead center every time on every concept in fact his is one artist of a few if not the only one who are officially recognized by tolkien s estate as a bard of middle earth therefore the illustrations in this beautiful edition of a great book by the 20th century s best author are bound to appeal to you as you read it in this book the arguing trolls are just as i ve imagined them and the dwarves are like real people not plump bodies with noses the size of their heads the eagles too are glorious i heartily recommend this edition of tolkien s wonderful fantasy

Toss in a little natural philosophy (sciences) and you have the making of a monster. Or at least a being that after being spurned for looking ugly becomes ugly. So for revenge the creature decides unless Victor makes another (female this time) creature, that Victor will also suffer the loss of friends and relatives. What is victor to do? Bow to the wishes and needs of his creation? Or challenge it to the death? What would you do?Although the concept of the monster is good, and the conflicts of the story well thought out, Shelly suffers from the writing style of the time. Many people do not finish the book as the language is stilted and verbose for example when was the last time you said, \"Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy of death.\"Much of the book seems like travel log filler. More time describing the surroundings of Europe than the reason for traveling or just traveling. Many writers use traveling to reflect time passing or the character growing in stature or knowledge. In this story they just travel a lot.This book is definitely worth plodding through for moviegoers. The record needs to be set strait. First shock is that the creator is named Victor Frankenstein; the creature is just \"monster\" not Frankenstein. And it is Victor that is backwards which added in him doing the impossible by not knowing any better. The monster is well read in \"Sorrows of a Young Werther,\" \"Paradise Lost,\" and Plutarch's \"Lives.\" The debate (mixed with a few murders) rages on as to whether the monster was doing evil because of his nature or because he was spurned?

     |A20EEWWSFMZ1PN|Victor grew up reading the works of Paracelsus, Agrippa, and Albertus Magnus, the alchemists of the time. Toss in a little natural philosophy (sciences) and you have the making of a monster. Or at least a being that after being spurned for looking ugly becomes ugly. So for revenge the creature decides unless Victor makes another (female this time) creature, that Victor will also suffer the loss of friends and relatives. What is victor to do? Bow to the wishes and needs of his creation? Or challenge it to the death? What would you do?Although the concept of the monster is good, and the conflicts of the story well thought out, Shelly suffers from the writing style of the time. Many people do not finish the book as the language is stilted and verbose for example when was the last time you said, \"Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy of death.\"Much of the book seems like travel log filler. More time describing the surroundings of Europe than the reason for traveling or just traveling. Many writers use traveling to reflect time passing or the character growing in stature or knowledge. In this story they just travel a lot.This book is definitely worth plodding through for moviegoers. The record needs to be set strait. First shock is that the creator is named Victor Frankenstein; the creature is just \"monster\" not Frankenstein. And it is Victor that is backwards which added in him doing the impossible by not knowing any better. The monster is well read in \"Sorrows of a Young Werther,\" \"Paradise Lost,\" and Plutarch's \"Lives.\" The debate (mixed with a few murders) rages on as to whether the monster was doing evil because of his nature or because he was spurned?The Thirteenth Floor

I've read all of her works, and this is one of my absolute favorites. Even though it was written so long ago, the plot could be something that happened to someone today. Persuasion is about a young couple who loves each other but is persuaded to end the relationship because the girl isn't \"acceptable\" for the boy since she doesn't come from a wealthy family. They eventually meet again, and the story continues to unfold. I actually used Persuasion for the subject of one of my long papers in college, and it was so fascinating to dig into the story as well as the story behind the story. There are actually a lot of similarities between this story and Jane's own story. Jane Austen is an incredible author, and Persuasion is one of her greatest works.

fantastic novel by Jane Austen. I've read all of her works, and this is one of my absolute favorites. Even though it was written so long ago, the plot could be something that happened to someone today. Persuasion is about a young couple who loves each other but is persuaded to end the relationship because the girl isn't \"acceptable\" for the boy since she doesn't come from a wealthy family. They eventually meet again, and the story continues to unfold. I actually used Persuasion for the subject of one of my long papers in college, and it was so fascinating to dig into the story as well as the story behind the story. There are actually a lot of similarities between this story and Jane's own story.

       |persuasion is a fantastic novel by jane austen i ve read all of her works and this is one of my absolute favorites even though it was written so long ago the plot could be something that happened to someone today persuasion is about a young couple who loves each other but is persuaded to end the relationship because the girl isn t acceptable for the boy since she doesn t come from a wealthy family they eventually meet again and the story continues to unfold i actually used persuasion for the subject of one of my long papers in college and it was so fascinating to dig into the story as well as the story behind the story there are actually a lot of similarities between this story and jane s own story jane austen is an incredible author and persuasion is one of her greatest

struggle, there are bound to be deviates; Winston Smith is one of those. He starts out, due to his inability to doublethink, with thoughtcrime. This is in a society that believes a thought is as real as the deed. Eventually he graduates through a series of misdemeanors to illicit sex and even plans to overthrow the very government that took him in as an orphan.If he gets caught, he will be sent to the \"Ministry of Love\" where they have a record of 100% cures for this sort of insanity. They will even forgive his past indiscretions.Be sure to watch the three different movies made from this book:1984 (1954) Peter Cushing is Winston Smith1984 (1956) Edmond O'Brien is Winston

(For actual content, read Amazon's description above. For my bent on the series, read on.)There are basically three main theories concerning Christ's return, based off scripture, and though I won't get into them here, this one is off the pre-tribulation theory. (Which is actually the same one I believe in.) The problem is, I know why I believe in this particular theory, whereas other Christian may simply read this book and say, \"Oh, so that's what's going to happen!\" Well, before you do that, check your Bible and other sources, and don't just base it off these books. OK, time to step off my soapbox...As far as writing talent, I have been VERY disappointed with all the books in this series. At first, I gave them the benefit of the doubt, thinking the writing was so simplistic so younger kids could read them too, until I discovered they have a young kids version out for this series, at which point I was just saddened. So don't expect a well-written novel, as I feel each book's writing has become more and more simple with each release. And by this, I don't mean the story doesn't flow, because it does. It's just written in such simply words that even a grade-schooler could read it without any problems.As far as content, you'll find stuff in here you like, I don't doubt that, but if you're like me, you'll be skimming many areas because you don't care about every single step that every single person takes to get from point A to point B. It's a tedious read at parts, but if you like the study of the end times, as do I, or like reading Christian novels, as do I, then these books will suffice. But don't base your belief system off them until you know more than just what's presented here, and certainly DON'T read them if literary content is your main goal as you won't find well-WRITTEN novels here. If it weren't for that fact alone, I'd be devouring these books as they came out, but as it is, I've read them after friends buy them and are done with them since I am interested in the story, but not the work it takes for me to constantly forgive the writing.|i am going to put the same review on each of the left behind series books because my reaction to each of them is basically the same for

is basically the same. (For actual content, read Amazon's description above. For my bent on the series, read on.)There are basically three main theories concerning Christ's return, based off scripture, and though I won't get into them here, this one is off the pre-tribulation theory. (Which is actually the same one I believe in.) The problem is, I know why I believe in this particular theory, whereas other Christian may simply read this book and say, \"Oh, so that's what's going to happen!\" Well, before you do that, check your Bible and other sources, and don't just base it off these books. OK, time to step off my soapbox...As far as writing talent, I have been VERY disappointed with all the books in this series. At first, I gave them the benefit of the doubt, thinking the writing was so simplistic so younger kids could read them too, until I discovered they have a young kids version out for this series, at which point I was just saddened. So don't expect a well-written novel, as I feel each book's writing has become more and more simple with each release. And by this, I don't mean the story doesn't flow, because it does. It's just written in such simply words that even a grade-schooler could read it without any problems.As far as content, you'll find stuff in here you like, I don't doubt that, but if you're like me, you'll be skimming many areas because you don't care about every single step that every single person takes to get from point A to point B. It's a tedious read at parts, but if you like the study of the end times, as do I, or like reading Christian novels, as do I, then these books will suffice. But don't base your belief system off them until you know more than just what's presented here, and certainly DON'T read them if literary content is your main goal as you won't find well-WRITTEN novels here. If it weren't for that fact alone, I'd be devouring these books as they came out, but as it is, I've read them after friends buy them and are done with them since I am interested in the story, but not the work it takes for me to constantly forgive the writing.FYI, this book was actually my favorite of the series.                                                                   |i am going to put the same review on each of the left behind series books because my reaction to each of them is basically the same for actual content read amazon s description above for my bent on the series read on

Hobbits are comfort loving creatures with no real sense for adventure. A knock on the door and Bilbo's life is about to change.Calling this book children's book is like calling \"Alice in Wonderland\" [see \"The Annotated Alice\"] a children's book. Yes children can read this book and it is fun. How ever there is a lot more to this book than a cute story. And it has all the depth of the other Tolkien works with the exception of being shorter.Many people look at this story as a prequel to \"The Lord of the Rings\", where in reality it is a stand-alone story with a perfectly good beginning, middle, and end. When you read \"The Lord of the Rings\" there is enough description to forgo \"The Hobbit.\" Personally, I find that reading The Lord of the Rings first gave me the in-depth background to better appreciate The Hobbit.Many of the creatures and adventures will put you on the edge of your seat. You will recognize the personalities and grow along will Bilbo as he faces new challenges as he learns to deal with life.A good book to read first would be \"The Power of Myth\" by Joseph Campbell. Then you get a clearer picture of why the story progresses as it does.Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth

time, many creatures lived in places like the Shire, home to Bilbo Baggins, Hobbit. Hobbits are comfort loving creatures with no real sense for adventure. A knock on the door and Bilbo's life is about to change.Calling this book children's book is like calling \"Alice in Wonderland\" [see \"The Annotated Alice\"] a children's book. Yes children can read this book and it is fun. How ever there is a lot more to this book than a cute story. And it has all the depth of the other Tolkien works with the exception of being shorter.Many people look at this story as a prequel to \"The Lord of the Rings\", where in reality it is a stand-alone story with a perfectly good beginning, middle, and end. When you read \"The Lord of the Rings\" there is enough description to forgo \"The Hobbit.\" Personally, I find that reading The Lord of the Rings first gave me the in-depth background to better appreciate The Hobbit.Many of the creatures and adventures will put you on the edge of your seat. You will recognize the personalities and grow along will Bilbo as he faces new challenges as he learns to deal with life.A good book to read first would be \"The Power of Myth\" by Joseph Campbell. Then you get a clearer picture of why the story progresses as it does.

Tolkien is the prequel to his blockbuster hit \"Lord of the Rings\". A must read for anyone who is a LOTR fan like me. This epic fantasy introduces the world of hobbits in Middle-Earth and one in particular Bilbo Baggins of the Shire. Bilbo lives comfortably on six meals a day in his hobbit hole under the hill in Bag-End. Not one to consider himself adventurous Bilbo with the nudging of his friend the Wizard Gandalf the Grey accompanies thirteen dwarves (Thorin, Balin, Dwalin, Kili, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur and Bombur) on a quest to reclaim their lost treasure from the dragon Smaug in the Lonely Mountain. Known as the Burglar Bilbo encounters many strange creatures including pony eating goblins, wargs, wolves, giant eagles, wood elves, man eating spiders, a talking dragon and Gollum.While lost in the Misty Mountains, Bilbo finds a golden ring. To hearing the cries of the creature Gollum he puts the ring in his pocket. Gollum has lost his precious (the ring). Upon meeting, Bilbo and Gollum strike a deal. They will play a riddling game. If Bilbo wins, Gollum will lead him out of the mountains. If Gollum wins, he gets to eat Bilbo. Although Bilbo wins, Gollum has no intention of helping Bilbo when suddenly the ring finds its way to Bilbo's hand and puff...he disappears. He becomes invisible. Bilbo uses this ability to escape the Misty Mountains with its goblins and many other pickles he will find himself in throughout the rest of his adventure to Mirkwood, Lake-town and the Lonely Mountain.Although this is a fantasy novel, it is not necessarily appropriate for small children.

Tolkien is the prequel to his blockbuster hit \"Lord of the Rings\". A must read for anyone who is a LOTR fan like me. This epic fantasy introduces the world of hobbits in Middle-Earth and one in particular Bilbo Baggins of the Shire. Bilbo lives comfortably on six meals a day in his hobbit hole under the hill in Bag-End. Not one to consider himself adventurous Bilbo with the nudging of his friend the Wizard Gandalf the Grey accompanies thirteen dwarves (Thorin, Balin, Dwalin, Kili, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur and Bombur) on a quest to reclaim their lost treasure from the dragon Smaug in the Lonely Mountain. Known as the Burglar Bilbo encounters many strange creatures including monsterous trolls, pony eating goblins, wargs, wolves, giant eagles, wood elves, man eating spiders, a talking dragon and Gollum.While lost in the Misty Mountains, Bilbo finds a golden ring. To hearing the cries of the creature Gollum he puts the ring in his pocket. Gollum has lost his precious (the ring). Upon meeting, Bilbo and Gollum strike a deal. They will play a riddling game. If Bilbo wins, Gollum will lead him out of the mountains. If Gollum wins, he gets to eat Bilbo. Although Bilbo wins, Gollum has no intention of helping Bilbo when suddenly the ring finds its way to Bilbo's hand and puff...he disappears. He becomes invisible. Bilbo uses this ability to escape the Misty Mountains with its goblins and many other pickles he will find himself in throughout the rest of his adventure to Mirkwood, Lake-town and the Lonely Mountain.Although this is a fantasy novel, it is not necessarily appropriate for small children.

If you are perusing these reviews under Moby Dick in an effort to see whether or not it is worth reading (which is why I personally scan these reviews) let me just say emphatically that it is. But... I would suggest that you not pick this book up lightly. It is a very stubborn work that in many ways is a precursor to the 20th century's flirtation with high literature. In many ways this book can be compared to the more stubborn works of Pynchon and Joyce in that you can read it over and over again and find an entirely new perspective in which to appreciate it every time.I picked Moby Dick up several times only to be frustrated with its seemingly antiquated cadence and structure. Luckily for myself I found a reading group a few years back that was delving into some classics and Moby Dick happened to be one of these works. It made all of the difference in the world to have a knowledgeable leader of a reading group opening up discussions after every few chapters to discuss what we had read. After undergoing this experience and finishing the book I was and still am in awe of the majesty Melville attained in these pages.Please, even if you are sure of yourself as a reader and scoff at my suggestion to use a reading group or class structure to enjoy this work, find a copy that will have a comprehensive `readers guide' in order to cast light on some of the complex and arcane references.

is why i personally scan these reviews let me just say emphatically that it is but i would suggest that you not pick this book up lightly it is a very stubborn work that in many ways is a precursor to the 20th century s flirtation with high literature in many ways this book can be compared to the more stubborn works of pynchon and joyce in that you can read it over and over again and find an entirely new perspective in which to appreciate it every time i picked moby dick up several times only to be frustrated with its seemingly antiquated cadence and structure luckily for myself i found a reading group a few years back that was delving into some classics and moby dick happened to be one of these works it made all of the difference in the world to have a knowledgeable leader of a reading group opening up discussions after every few chapters to discuss what we had read after undergoing this experience and finishing the book i was and still am in awe of the majesty melville attained in these pages please even if you are sure of yourself as a reader and scoff at my suggestion to use a reading group or class structure to enjoy this work find a copy that will have a comprehensive readers guide in order to cast light on some of the complex and arcane references this will be helpful if only to note how uniquely melville manipulates the focus of his story and the characters contained with in enjoy this book and please don t open its pages on a whim unless you have plenty of free time patience and a curiosity to uncover ideas or meanings that might not be so

Whale (Harper's Modern Classics)                             |ABWF7YVZAU1QP |I just wanted to put in my two cents here. If you are perusing these reviews under Moby Dick in an effort to see whether or not it is worth reading (which is why I personally scan these reviews) let me just say emphatically that it is. But... I would suggest that you not pick this book up lightly. It is a very stubborn work that in many ways is a precursor to the 20th century's flirtation with high literature. In many ways this book can be compared to the more stubborn works of Pynchon and Joyce in that you can read it over and over again and find an entirely new perspective in which to appreciate it every time.I picked Moby Dick up several times only to be frustrated with its seemingly antiquated cadence and structure. Luckily for myself I found a reading group a few years back that was delving into some classics and Moby Dick happened to be one of these works. It made all of the difference in the world to have a knowledgeable leader of a reading group opening up discussions after every few chapters to discuss what we had read. After undergoing this experience and finishing the book I was and still am in awe of the majesty Melville attained in these pages.Please, even if you are sure of yourself as a reader and scoff at my suggestion to use a reading group or class structure to enjoy this work, find a copy that will have a comprehensive `readers guide' in order to cast light on some of the complex and arcane references. This will be helpful if only to note how uniquely Melville manipulates the focus of his story and the characters contained with in.Enjoy this book, and don't open its pages on a whim unless you have

see whether or not it is worth reading which is why i personally scan these reviews let me just say emphatically that it is but i would suggest that you not pick this book up lightly it is a very stubborn work that in many ways is a precursor to the 20th century s flirtation with high literature in many ways this book can be compared to the more stubborn works of pynchon and joyce in that you can read it over and over again and find an entirely new perspective in which to appreciate it every time i picked moby dick up several times only to be frustrated with its seemingly antiquated cadence and structure luckily for myself i found a reading group a few years back that was delving into some classics and moby dick happened to be one of these works it made all of the difference in the world to have a knowledgeable leader of a reading group opening up discussions after every few chapters to discuss what we had read after undergoing this experience and finishing the book i was and still am in awe of the majesty melville attained in these pages please even if you are sure of yourself as a reader and scoff at my suggestion to use a reading group or class structure to enjoy this work find a copy that will have a comprehensive readers guide in order to cast light on some of the complex and arcane references this will be helpful if only to note how uniquely melville manipulates the focus of his story and the characters contained with in enjoy this book and don t open its pages on a whim unless you have plenty of free time patience and a curiosity to uncover ideas or meanings that might not be so apparent at a first reading

The idea of a storyteller in the story is not unique but very effective. We could ponder over the word darkness for quite some time. The best way to ponder is with Cliff's Notes. Personally I wanted him to get on with it. I guess I was a little impatient for the action and the conclusion. If it hadn't been for cliff notes I would have missed haft the things he was implying.A merchant company is missing an agent Kurtz, and Marlowe must find him. Traveling though harsher environments than he imagined possible he may have found what he was seeking. As with many of this type of epic the physical distance or direction is not as important then the transformation it plays on ones soul.I missed this book somehow in school. The reason I started to read this book before actually I actually became immersed in it, was to see how close it came to the movie. No not the movie you are thinking of. \"Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death\" (1988) ASIN: 6305078599 .

She progressed to books as \"The Fountainhead\" where she could describe the problem quite well. Now in \"Atlas Shrugged she has come up with a plausible answer to the problem. In essence, your head can work without your hands yet your hands cannot work without your head.The story is not unique but it still holds you attention. The world is becoming more socialized and it is harder for individuals to make an impact without having a multitude of parasites on their back. Some chose to fight, others chose to ignore; some do not have a clue as to what is happening. The world seems to be gearing down is just coincidence or is there some one taking a hand in it. \"Who is John Galt?\"I can tell you of my experience with the book. I must have been a late bloomer or just unlucky, because I did not come across \"Atlas shrugged\" until I was 20 years old. I was in the military and needed some reading material. My younger sister sent me the book. It looks just a little thick to me but I started reading, and reading and reading. I do not know if it was the story or the clarity of thought. Now I saw everything in a new or different light. It felt weird to see the newspapers and politics paralleling the book.I was in New York (West Point) at the time and three things stood out to this day. This was a public service announcement on the TV \"The law says that an apartment owner can not charge more than 30% of what you make\" and at the same time, the apartment buildings were closing down. The postal carriers went on strike and the military had to deliver the mail. That winter the snowplow drivers went on strike. When the strike was over the snowplows were missing. They found them the next summer in an empty lot.There is nothing quite as convincing as watching the world and book parallel each other. I have mellowed out some lately. However, I really think that this book should be read by high school age where it would have maximum impact of one's train of thought.        |in case this is your first encounter with this book it is

buildings were closing down the postal carriers went on strike and the military had to deliver the mail that winter the snowplow drivers went on strike when the strike was over the snowplows were missing they found them the next summer in an empty lot there is nothing quite as convincing as watching the world and book parallel each other i have mellowed out some lately however i really think

            |A20EEWWSFMZ1PN|In case this is your first encounter with this book, It is a fresh story but a continuation to Ayn Rand's philosophy that started out with books like \"We the living\" where she new something was wrong but could not put her finger on it. She progressed to books as \"The Fountainhead\" where she could describe the problem quite well. Now in \"Atlas Shrugged she has come up with a plausible answer to the problem. In essence your head can work without your hands yet your hands can not work without your head.The story is not unique but it still holds you attention. The world is becoming more socialized and it is harder for individuals to make an impact without having a multitude of parasites on their back. Some chose to fight, others chose to ignore; some do not have a clue as to what is happening. The world seems to be gearing down is just coincidence or is there some one taking a hand in it. \"Who is John Galt?\"I can tell you of my experience with the book. I must have been a late bloomer or just unlucky, because I did not come across \"Atlas shrugged\" until I was 20 years old. I was in the military and needed some reading material. My younger sister sent me the book. It looks just a little thick to me but I started reading, and reading and reading. I do not know if it was the story or the clarity of thought. Now I saw everything in a new or different light. It felt weird to see the newspapers and politics paralleling the book.I was in New York (West Point) at the time and three things stood out to this day. This was a public service announcement on the TV \"The law says that an apartment owner can not charge more than 30% of what you make\" and at the same time the apartment buildings were closing down. The postal carriers went on strike and the military had to deliver the mail. That winter the snowplow drivers went on strike. When the strike was over the snowplows were missing. They found them the next summer in an empty lot.There is nothing quite as convincing as watching the world and book parallel each other. I have mellowed out some lately. However, I really think that this book should be read by high school age where it would have maximum impact of one's train of thought.It is only fitting that it should be available on the Kindle and mayby one day will be a movie. (hope the movie is a period piece)|in case this is your first encounter with this book it is a fresh story but a continuation to ayn rand s philosophy that started out with books like we the living

I was bored as I read it, and kept waiting for more to happen. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

These particular editions are not ones I can imagine any discerning collector would want to own.I bought the two books because I am not a fan of Alan Lee's work and I couldn't find any other current hardback editions that used Tolkien's original drawings, (as the \"Leatherette\" Hobbit does). The truth is though that these are the most tacky and tasteless editions I've seen and the print and paper quality of both books is very poor. The colouring of the drawings in The Hobbit is a disgrace and numerous pages in my copy of the LOTR were so smudged they were unreadable.Don't buy them if you haven't already and if you've already

made the mistake send them back with a complaint and write a scathing review to try and save someone else the trouble

He starts out, due to his inability to doublethink, with thoughtcrime. This is in a society that believes a thought is as real as the deed. Eventually he graduates through a series of misdemeanors to illicit sex and even plans to overthrow the very government that took him in as an orphan.If he gets caught, he will be sent to the \"Ministry of Love\" where they have a record of 100% cures for this sort of insanity. They will even forgive his past indiscretions.Be sure to watch the three different movies made from this book:1984 (1954) Peter Cushing is Winston Smith1984 (1956) Edmond O'Brien is Winston

struggle, there are bound to be deviates; Winston Smith is one of those. He starts out, due to his inability to doublethink, with thoughtcrime. This is in a society that believes a thought is as real as the deed. Eventually he graduates through a series of misdemeanors to illicit sex and even plans to overthrow the very government that took him in as an orphan.If he gets caught, he will be sent to the \"Ministry of Love\" where they have a record of 100% cures for this sort of insanity. They will even forgive his past indiscretions.Be sure to watch the three different movies made from this book:1984 (1954) Peter Cushing is Winston Smith1984 (1956) Edmond O'Brien is Winston

If it is meant to be it will live through anything. .. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

first chapter is a model of precision. in only nine pages, a handful of characters are introduced with masterful clarity. subtle dialouge paints a portrait of each character with a depth that many novelists never achieve over the course of hundreds of pages. jane austen's supreme talent is shining bright. then what happens? it goes on and on and on. and i got severely bored. i did not care about emma's social schemes, her obssession with ones rank within society. she is simply a dull character. and the language ultimately grows tiresome. the purple prose weighed heavy on my poor brain after a hundred pages. a bit beyond page 220 i jumped ship. i simply could not finish the book. sorry.

Lennie is a huge man with an ironic mind, he all the time gets in trouble accidently,George is a small man,but has a quick mind. These two left Weed to Soledad where they attemped to realize their dreams which is to get their own land and have a good life, not to spend their money at a cat house. Since they are not lonely like the other migrant workers. Lennie and George have each others.This book is wonderful and at the same time sad.I recommend this book because it exlains the value of friendship ,how the migrant workers are lonely,how they live and what their dreams are.In this book i love the innocent Lennie as well as George who did his best to protect his only and best friend.

migrant workers.Lennie and George are two migrant worker with different personalities. Lennie is a huge man with an ironic mind, he all the time gets in trouble accidently,George is a small man,but has a quick mind. These two left Weed to Soledad where they attemped to realize their dreams which is to get their own land and have a good life, not to spend their money at a cat house. Since they are not lonely like the other migrant workers. Lennie and George have each others.This book is wonderful and at the same time sad.I recommand this book because it exlains the value of friendship ,how the migrant workers are lonely,how they live and what their dreams are.In this book i love the innocent Lennie as well as George who did his best to protect his only and best friend.

            "|0.9222222222222223|B0006AQG7U|The time machine,: An invention,                                |A30QQPDAPOCO3T|This book has been required reading in High Schools for years. My experience is that school actually demotivates people from wanting to read. How many of us can relate with the feelings of never wanting to read another book after high school. When grades are the motivation to read, people search for the cliff notes and or look for reviews in Encyclopedias. In my High School English class, grades were given on the basis of how many books one read. If you read 8-10 you received an A. The problem was that after knowing one was going to get an A, all reading stopped. Reading is supposed to be done for the joy of it. I hear the word boring used a great deal when reviewing a book. I know so many kids who end up hating reading because they received a poor grade. The classics including The Time Machine are challenging books. I would never use boring as an adjective to describe a book however.

required reading in high schools for years my experience is that school actually demotivates people from wanting to read how many of us can relate with the feelings of never wanting to read another book after high school when grades are the motivation to read people search for the cliff notes and or look for reviews in encyclopedias in my high school english class grades were given on the basis of how many books one read if you read 8 10 you received an a the problem was that after knowing one was going to get an a all reading stopped reading is supposed to be done for the joy of it i hear the word boring used a great deal when reviewing a book i know so many kids who end up hating reading because they received a poor grade the classics including the time machine are challenging books i

for years. My experience is that school actually demotivates people from wanting to read. How many of us can relate with the feelings of never wanting to read another book after high school. When grades are the motivation to read, people search for the cliff notes and or look for reviews in Encyclopedias. In my High School English class, grades were given on the basis of how many books one read. If you read 8-10 you received an A. The problem was that after knowing one was going to get an A, all reading stopped. Reading is supposed to be done for the joy of it. I hear the word boring used a great deal when reviewing a book. I know so many kids who end up hating reading because they received a poor grade. The classics are challenging books. I would never use boring as an adjective to describe a book however.

It was the perfect setting, as we two were the only English speaking people in the town. I think now is the right time to review the book, because I can only recall the feelings left behind by this powerful work of literature. Most of the plot and many of the characters have been long forgotten, leaving only the residue of strong emotion. I have read many works of powerful fiction by the world's great authors since then. But not one of them affected me emotionally the way this extraordinary tale did. I remember one gray German morning finishing the chapter where Heathcliff digs up the body of his beloved Catherine because he has gone mad in his desire to hold her close once more. And then off to the Altenkirch Schwanenkellerei I went. I spent the rest of the day working quietly in the cellars of the winery, deep inside the mountain with mold hanging all about, and brooding over the maniacal behavior of these highly romantic, insane characters. I've never been able to shake the feeling entirely. There is something so entirely timeless about this work, as though it were a piece of ancient literature, old far beyond the 1840s setting, something so utterly classical and piercingly primordial, it's as though you already had the genesis of this material in your DNA and it only required this story to bring it back to life within you. You recognize the spell it weaves because it speaks to the humanity in you so clearly, it is as though you have been secretly drugged. The English language has rarely been utilized as well as it has here, and I dare say you would need to go back to Shakespeare to find its parallel. Romanticism reached its high water mark with this novel. Ms. Bront has now become immortal because of her creation, and in the Pantheon of world literaure, she stands among the Titans.

wife 23 years ago. At the time, I was working as an apprentice at a winery on the Rhine River. There was an old medeival castle across the river from our room. It was the perfect setting, as we two were the only English speaking people in the town. I think now is the right time to review the book, because I can only recall the feelings left behind by this powerful work of literature. Most of the plot and many of the characters have been long forgotten, leaving only the residue of strong emotion. I have read many works of powerful fiction by the world's great authors since then. But not one of them affected me emotionally the way this extraordinary tale did. I remember one gray German morning finishing the chapter where Heathcliff digs up the body of his beloved Catherine because he has gone mad in his desire to hold her close once more. And then off to the Altenkirch Schwanenkellerei I went. I spent the rest of the day working quietly in the cellars of the winery, deep inside the mountain with mold hanging all about, and brooding over the maniacal behavior of these highly romantic, insane characters. I've never been able to completely shake the feeling. There is something so entirely timeless about this work, as though it were a piece of ancient literature, old far beyond the 1840s setting, something so utterly classical and piercingly primordial, it's as though you already had the genesis of this material in your DNA and it only required this story to bring it back to life within you. You recognize the spell it weaves because it speaks to the humanity in you so clearly. It is as though you have been secretly drugged. The English language has rarely been utilized as well as it has here, and I dare say you would need to go back to Shakespeare to find its parallel. Romanticism reached its high water mark with this novel. Ms. Bronte has now become immortal because of her creation, and in the Pantheon of world literaure, she stands among the Titans.

I am glad I read it and finished it. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel.

Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a a mess of things as she tries to manage the affairs of others.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel.

            "|0.9019607843137255|B000PMCF1A|The Catcher in the Rye [Audiobook] [Cd] [Unabridged] (Audio CD) |NULL          |After you read this you'll wonder what in the life of a teenager has really changed from the 50's to the 90's. It reads like teenager's act and speak in today's schools and in society. The arrogant \"I know everything\" attitude is masterfully detailed by Salinger. The sex, alcohol, and \"don't give a damn\" attitude of Holden is really the reality of just about every teenager, even today. That is what makes Salinger's book a classic. Holden is someone we either were or someone we knew at some point in our lives. We ALL sympathize with Holden, yet at the same time we say to ourselves, \"what the hell is this kid thinking?\" Yet, we all know exactly what he is thinking, even if we don't like to admit it! If you open your mind and your heart to Holden Caulfield, you are really opening up to what went on in yourself as a teenager and what is going on in the mind of your teenagers! Caulfield reminds me of the character, Joe Green, a troubled soul on a quest to understand his past in Steiger's new master piece, Alien Rapture. I highly endorse buying this book. It is a must read!

After you read this you'll wonder what in the life of a teenager has really changed from the 50's to the 90's.It reads like teenager's act and speak in today's schools and in society. The arrogant \"I know everything\" attitude is masterfully detailed by Salinger. The sex, alcohol, and \"don't give a damn\" attitude of Holden is really the reality of just about every teenager, even today. That is what makes Salinger's book a classic.Holden is someone we either were or someone we knew at some point in our lives. We ALL sympathize with Holden, yet at the same time we say to ourselves, \"what the hell is this kid thinking?\" Yet, we all know exactly what he is thinking, even if we don't like to admit it! If you open your mind and your heart to Holden Caulfield, you are really opening up to what went on in yourself as a teenager and what is going on in the mind of your teenagers!Caulfield reminds me of the character, Joe Green, a troubled soul on a quest to understand his past in Steiger's new master piece, 'Alien Rapture', which has a real page turning plot. I highly endorse buying this book. It is a must read!

veteran comic book illustrator (You can find my work here on Amazon.com; I am the CO-creator and artist of Transmetropolitan), I am often asked to recommend books to aspiring professionals in comic book illustration. In that case I always enthusiastically recommend any of Eisner's instructional books as essential reading for anyone serious about their craft and dreams of getting into the industry.From the earliest work of his career, Will Eisner was an innovator in writing as well as illustration. Even in his twilight years the man is still a vigorous and creative artist producing work that pros as well as fans can't wait to get their hands on.These books display his genius in an entertaining and easy to follow method, and if put to practice will inspire and reveal hidden keys to making your work truly professional grade. A great companion book to Eisner's \"Graphic Storytelling\".- Darick Roberston

Cornwell takes you from your reading room, and teleports you back to a simpler time. And you find out that it's not so simple. Set against the backdrop of the Eastern Theatre in the American Civil War, he portrays the massive carnage and greatest bravery in minute detail. You actually hear the cannons, and smell the rotting flesh of the wounded. Yet, the main plot does not take place amongst the gunfire outside. But, rather, within. It is a story of a soul, and his struggle with God, man, who he is, and what he stands for. Amidst the shouting, crying, blasting, and dieing...is a poor heart, searching for peace. I found Cornwell's protrayal of Nate Starbuck to be no less than perfect. I found myself rooting, questioning, hoping, and praying for this fictional character. For, I saw myself in Nate. The same questions, fears, and desires. When done, I walked away from this story with a different outlook on life, liberty, and what's truly important.

Maybe that's it Colonel. Maybe none of this is real. We're all in hell\"I cannot rate this book without talking about the brilliance of the whole series. Cornwell takes you from your reading room, and teleports you back to a simpler time. And you find out that it's not so simple. Set against the backdrop of the Eastern Theatre in the American Civil War, he portrays the massive carnage and greatest bravery in minute detail. You actually hear the cannons, and smell the rotting flesh of the wounded. Yet, the main plot does not take place amongst the gunfire outside. But, rather, within. It is a story of a soul, and his struggle with God, man, who he is, and what he stands for. Amidst the shouting, crying, blasting, and dieing...is a poor heart, searching for peace. I found Cornwell's protrayal of Nate Starbuck to be no less than perfect. I found myself rooting, questioning, hoping, and praying for this fictional character. For, I saw myself in Nate. The same questions, fears, and desires. When done, I walked away from this story with a different outlook on life, liberty, and what's truly important.

and went to hell maybe that s it colonel maybe none of this is real we re all in hell i cannot rate this book without talking about the brilliance of the whole series cornwell takes you from your reading room and teleports you back to a simpler time and you find out that it s not so simple set against the backdrop of the eastern theatre in the american civil war he portrays the massive carnage and greatest bravery in minute detail you actually hear the cannons and smell the rotting flesh of the wounded yet the main plot does not take place amongst the gunfire outside but rather within it is a story of a soul and his struggle with god man who he is and what he stands for amidst the shouting crying blasting and dieing is a poor heart searching for peace i found cornwell s protrayal of nate starbuck to be no less than perfect i found myself rooting questioning hoping and praying for this fictional character for i saw myself in nate the same questions fears and desires when done i walked away from this story with a different outlook on life liberty and what s truly important as will you

It is also interesting to read because it talks about how George and Lennie develop a common friendship among each other. George is short and takes care of Lennie because Lennie has a mind of a child. They both use to work in a weed but they had to leave because of an incident that had occured. They went to a new weed in Solidad where there they had many dreams ahead. In the new weed they met new people which made George and Lennie Friendships grow even more. For example Lennie has been in a fight with curley; George told him to fight back and so he did which, led Lennie to breaking Curley's hand.Even though the ending is sad, George and Lennie friendship can insipires everyone because they look out for each other.Even though Lennie is a big and huge he is a kind person.This is an excellent book written by John Steinbeck with a sad ending. Through out the pages you can see how much George cares about Lennie. I enjoyed reading this book and it has inspired me to have stronger friendship with my friends. Therefore I would like to recommend this book to those whom are interested in reading books about friendships.

Lennie. It is also interesting to read because it talks about how George and Lennie develop a common friendship among each other. George is short and takes care of Lennie because Lennie has a mind of a child. They both use to work in a weed but they had to leave because of an incident that had occur. They went to a new weed in Solidad where there they had many dreams ahead. In the new weed they met new people which made George and Lennie Friendships grow even more. For example Lennie has been in a fight with curley, George told him to fight back and so he did which, led Lennie to breaking Curley's hand.Even though the ending is sad, George and Lennie friendship can insipires everyone because they look out for each other.Even though Lennie is a big and huge he is a kind person.This is an excellent book writen ny John Steinbeck with a sad ending. Through out the pages you can see how much George cares about Lennie. I enjoyed reading this book and it has inspired me to have stronger friendship with my friends. Therefore I would like to recommend this book to those whom are interested in reading books about friendships.

Even though there seems to be plenty of examples, the books short fall is on explanations (i.e. how to get from one step to the next). This textbook also seems to make many assumptions about what the student may or may not know about prerequisite material. Definitions and General Formulas are not clearly boxed or highlighted, like you'd find in a James Stewart textbook. I'm currently looking for another Differential Equation textbook, in order to actually learn the material, and make it through my class this semester. I'm completely lost with this book. As a student (Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan) I've purchased many math textbooks over the years, and this one would probably rank as the worst- I would NOT recommend this book.

             |A172AW5IS4Z79Y|This book is simply awful, one of the worst textbooks I've used for class purposes. Even though there seems to be plenty of examples, the books short fall is on explanations (i.e. how to get from one step to the next). This textbook also seems to make many assumptions about what the student may or may not know about prerequisite material. Definitions and General Formulas are not clearly boxed or highlighted- like you would find in a James Stewart textbook. I'm currently looking for another Differential Equation textbook, in order to actually learn the material, and make it through my class this semester. I'm completely lost with this book. As a student (Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan) I've purchased many (12+) math textbooks over the years, and this one would probably rank as the worst- I would NOT recommend this book.

I was bored as I read it, and kept waiting for more to happen. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

If it is meant to be it will live through anything. .. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

It is a tale of a small, cruel, and heartless man changing into a kind and generous soul. He is helped by a long dead friend, Jacob Marley, who wishes to save Scrooge of a eternal fate of walking the Earth forever with the weight of his sins upon him. Jacob changes Scrooge by having him haunted by three ghosts who show him all the people he has hurt and all the people he will hurt if he does not change.After the spirits visit Scrooge he rewards the Cratchit family with an anonymously sent Goose and immediately finds a charity, to which he generously donates. He also makes amends with his nephew Fred that has been trying to change Scrooge for years. Finally he helps Bob Cratchit by raising his salary so that Tiny Tim may survive.I think this book is great for the family and though it is a little difficult I think it is suited for anyone over 12 years old.

Carol [One Voice Recordings Edition]                                    |NULL          |This book is one of the most meaningful of all time and one I think should be read more often than just watched on television during the Christmas season. It is a tale of a small, cruel, and heartless man changing into a kind and generous soul. He is helped by a long dead friend, Jacob Marley, who wishes to save Scrooge of a eternal fate of walking the Earth forever with the weight of his sins upon him. Jacob changes Scrooge by having him haunted by three ghosts who show him all the people he has hurt and all the people he will hurt if he does not change.After the spirts visit Scrooge he rewards the Cratchit family with an anonomously sent Goose and immediately finds a charity, to which he generously donates. He also makes amends with his nephew Fred that has been trying to change Scrooge for years. Finally he helps Bob Cratchit by raising his salary so that Tiny Tim may survive.I think this book is great for the family and though it is a little difficult I think it is suited for anyone over 12 years old.

read more often than just watched on television during the christmas season it is a tale of a small cruel and heartless man changing into a kind and generous soul he is helped by a long dead friend jacob marley who wishes to save scrooge of a eternal fate of walking the earth forever with the weight of his sins upon him jacob changes scrooge by having him haunted by three ghosts who show him all the people he has hurt and all the people he will hurt if he does not change after the spirts visit scrooge he rewards the cratchit family with an anonomously sent goose and immediately finds a charity to which he generously donates he also makes amends with his nephew fred that has been trying to change scrooge for years finally he helps bob cratchit by raising his salary so that tiny tim may survive i think this book is great for the family and though it is a little difficult i think it is suited for anyone over 12 years old

It is a FULLY illustrated edition, With almost 140 pages of drawings at the style of a comic book but infinitly better done. Rich in color and detail, beautifull emotions on faces and well depicted places, perfect consistency with the book. More than that!!!. It has extracts from the book incredible well chosen, from a narrator point of view ,including dialogs mixed in such a way that there is almost no missing point treated in the original work, so text and reading is not lacking. I have not seen this kind of book in decades, It is one of the proudest books I have in my collection.

There are so many new, contemporary novles. If you want to another read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

These books are very colorful, with lots of illustrations and photos of genuine artifacts, maps, and people from the era in which the story is set. Side panel text gives background information about the author, pictures and story. These \"additions\" (which do not detract from, but only enhance the story) help the young reader (and the adult too!) put the story into context. It is like getting both a classic and a pictorial history book rolled into one! The text is easy to read. My daughter is now 9, and reading the books on her own. Not only has she developed an appreciation for classic literature, but for history as well. These are great books for parents to read with their children. I highly recommend them!

which \"A Christmas Carol\" is part of) for several years, since she was 5. These books are very colorful, with lots of illustrations and photos of genuine artifacts, maps, and people from the era in which the story is set. Side panel text gives background information about the author, pictures and story. These \"additions\" (which do not detract from, but only enhance the story) help the young reader (and the adult too!) put the story into context. It is like getting both a classic and a pictorial history book rolled into one! The text is easy to read. My daughter is now 9, and reading the books on her own. Not only has she developed an appreciation for classic literature, but for history as well. These are great books for parents to read with their children. I highly recommend them!

I am glad I read it and finished it. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

I was bored as I read it, and kept waiting for more to happen. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

I am glad I read it and finished it. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

If it is meant to be it will live through anything. .. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift!

I enjoye reading it and felt that the characters were people I had known all of my life. It was a good read. If you want to read another book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

There are already major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel. There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the Bantam, Berkley, and Black Dog & Leventhal editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them.

                 |A1CPSCL93S0VS8|What \"improvements\" have been made for the St. Martin's Minotaur edition? There are already major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel. There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the Signet, Bantam, Berkley, and Black Dog & Leventhal editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them. Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed.

It would certainly be worth the $1.99 list price, but free is even better.If you've read any of Dumas' other novels you'll probably like this one. It begins rather slowly and without drama but the intensity quickly builds as does the intrigue and violence. Writing reviews about mysteries is challenging because I don't want to give too much away but I do want to encourage fans of Dumas' other works, Edgar Allan Poe's short stories, and those who just enjoy period literature to read this book because it really is a good one.The characters are lively and there is even a strong secondary female character. Dumas' writing, while not overly emotional in and of itself, definitely provokes emotion in defense of his strong characters. The villian is repulsive and unlikeable while the soon to be identified hero is awkwardly charming and by turns wiley.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, but in the spirit of full disclosure I was an English major that primarily dealt with British literature so perhaps that's why I enjoyed this book so much. For non-English majors this book might be too stilted or old timey but for anyone who enjoys mysteries, suspense, or gardening this book is a great freebie to download.

It begins rather slowly and without drama but the intensity quickly builds as does the intrigue and violence. Writing reviews about mysteries is challenging because I don't want to give too much away but I do want to encourage fans of Dumas' other works, Edgar Allan Poe's short stories, and those who just enjoy period literature to read this book because it really is a good one.The characters are lively and there is even a strong secondary female character. Dumas' writing, while not overly emotional in and of itself, definitely provokes emotion in defense of his strong characters. The villian is repulsive and unlikeable while the soon to be identified hero is awkwardly charming and by turns wiley.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, but in the spirit of full disclosure I was an English major that primarily dealt with British literature so perhaps that's why I enjoyed this book so much. For non-English majors this book might be too stilted or old timey but for anyone who enjoys mysteries, suspense, or gardening this book is a great one to download.

ll probably like this one it begins rather slowly and without drama but the intensity quickly builds as does the intrigue and violence writing reviews about mysteries is challenging because i don t want to give too much away but i do want to encourage fans of dumas other works edgar allan poe s short stories and those who just enjoy period literature to read this book because it really is a good one the characters are lively and there is even a strong secondary female character dumas writing while not overly emotional in and of itself definitely provokes emotion in defense of his strong characters the villian is repulsive and unlikeable while the soon to be identified hero is awkwardly charming and by turns wiley i thoroughly enjoyed reading this book but in the spirit of full disclosure i was an english major that primarily dealt with british literature so perhaps that s why i enjoyed this book so much for non english majors this book might be too stilted or old timey but for anyone who enjoys mysteries suspense or gardening this book is a great one to download

Tolkien's fantasy classic,The Hobbit. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first book of three (followed byThe Two Towers: Being the Second Part of The Lord of the Rings,The Return of the King: Being the Third Part of The Lord of the Rings), but it is actually one epic tale.More adult oriented concepts are included than in The Hobbit, and there are refferences to the pre-history Tolkien was developing and published in various \"Middle Earth\" books, making this a more challenging read (I always have trouble getting through the first part of The Two Towers).The story picks up some years after Bilbo Baggins returns from the adventure told in The Hobbit. Now older, Bilbo is ready to leave his beloved home in the Shire, passing most of his possessions (including the Magic Ring he aquired in The Hobbit) to his nephew Frodo. Gandolf, the wizzard, has doubts about the Ring that are soon proven correct and a great quest is set before the young Hobbit and his group of friends.This is an epic tale, with many story lines running concurrently. This has it all, Monsters, Wizards, Battles, Treason, Love, Self Sacrifice and much more!Highly recommended!

Tolkien's fantasy classic,The Hobbit. While it is generaly sold in three book sets (The Fellowship of the Ring: Being the First Part of The Lord of the Rings,The Two Towers: Being the Second Part of The Lord of the Rings,The Return of the King: Being the Third Part of The Lord of the Rings), it is actually one epic tale.More adult oriented concepts are included than in The Hobbit, and there are refferences to the pre-history Tolkien was developing and published in various \"Middle Earth\" books, making this a more challenging read (I always have trouble getting through the first part of The Two Towers).The story picks up some years after Bilbo Baggins returns from the adventure told in The Hobbit. Now older, Bilbo is ready to leave his beloved home in the Shire, passing most of his possessions (including the Magic Ring he aquired in The Hobbit) to his nephew Frodo. Gandolf, the wizzard, has doubts about the Ring that are soon proven correct and a great quest is set before the young Hobbit and his group of friends.This is an epic tale, with many story lines running concurrently. This has it all, Monsters, Wizards, Battles, Treason, Love, Self Sacrifice and much more!Highly recommended!

There are already major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel. There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the Signet, Bantam, and Berkley editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them. Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed.

There are already major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel. There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the Signet, Bantam, Berkley, and Black Dog & Leventhal editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them.

Maybe I was expecting too much, something grander along the line of the Dune series. But the book in of itself is an extreme disappointment. I realize Asimov was young (21) when he wrote this, but his style leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take an early Arthur C. Clarke book over Asimov any day. This is the first book by Asimov I've read and I'm not sure I want to read another. His style is very dialogue driven with very few, if any, detail given to what the characters think. Everyone is very two-dimensional. And he never describes any of the scenes were all of this dialog takes place. Part of the interest in science-fiction is exploring new places, seeing different things. This entire story could have taken place on an empty stage. In fact, it seems like it's written more for a play than a novel. As for the story, it starts out interestingly enough. The Empire is going to crumble and to avoid thousands of years of dark-ages, a Foundation is set up to preserve the past learning's of the Empire. Well, that's what the original thought was at least. Soon we discover there's an alternate motive to this. Once we learn of this motive, the story goes straight downhill. Asimov skips decades from one page to another. Characters are introduced that we know practically nothing about, and he never tells us anything about them. I've read history books that had more character development than he gives the people in this book. By the time I got to the end I found myself saying \"So what\"? Am I supposed to continue on reading this series because it's been called a \"classic\". I've seen the word \"classic\" thrown around a little too much sometimes. This is definitely one of those times.

Maybe I was expecting too much, something grander along the line of the Dune series. But the book in of itself is an extreme disappointment. I realize Asimov was young (21) when he wrote this, but his style leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take an early Arthur C. Clarke book over Asimov anyday. This is the first book by Asimov I've read and I'm not sure I want to read another. His style is very dialoge driven with very few, if any, detail given to what the characters think. Everyone is very two-dimensional. And he never describes any of the scenes were all of this dialog takes place. Part of the interest in science-fiction is exploring new places, seeing different things. This entire story could have taken place on an empty stage. In fact, it seems like it's written more for a play than a novel. As for the story, it starts out interestingly enough. The Empire is going to crumble and to avoid thousands of years of dark-ages, a Foundation is set up to preserve the past learnings of the Empire. Well, that's what the original thought was at least. Soon we discover there's an alternate motive to this. Once we learn of this motive, the story goes straight downhill. Asimov skips decades from one page to another. Characters are introduced that we know pratically nothing about, and he never tells us anything about them. I've read history books that had more character development than he gives the people in this book. By the time I got to the end I found myself saying \"So what\"? Am I supposed to continue on reading this series because it's been called a \"classic\". I've seen the word \"classic\" thrown around a little too much sometimes. This is defintely one of those times.

I was bored as I read it, and kept waiting for more to happen. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

great book, years ago, and it still is, but I think it is outdarted for those living today and this modern world. There are so many new, contemporary novles. If you want to another read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

If it is meant to be it will live through anything. .. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

great book, years ago, and it still is, but I think it is outdarted for those living today and this modern world. There are so many new, contemporary novles. If you want to another read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

I was bored as I read it, and kept waiting for more to happen. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift!

different than any other book I have ever read, and I found it interesting. I enjoye reading it and felt that the characters were people I had known all of my life. It was a good read. If you want to read another book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

The author himself over-egged the pudding somewhat by inserting far too many personal observations,which bordered at times on pomposity, seemingly to try to point the reader in the direction he/she is meant to think. But amongst it there was a nugget of truth, which shone above all else, and really is the essence of the story - \"Though you...never see him again, or forget his very name, (he) will work in your thoughts till you die. It isn't possible to love and to part. You will wish that it was. You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you.

comedy...' nor '...a witty observation of the English middle classes...'In short I found it a disappointingly dreary love story and filled with characters none of whom, with the exception of George Emerson and his father, was particularly likeable. The author himself over-egged the pudding somewhat by inserting far too many personal observations,which bordered at times on pomposity, seemingly to try to point the reader in the direction he/she is meant to think. But amongst it there was a nugget of truth, which shone above all else - \"Though you...never see him again, or forget his very name, (he) will work in your thoughts till you die. It isn't possible to love and to part. You will wish that it was. You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you. I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal.\" (p.223 Penguin Classics edition).

If it is meant to be it will live through anything. .. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

different than any other book I have ever read, and I found it interesting. I enjoye reading it and felt that the characters were people I had known all of my life. It was a good read. If you want to read another book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.

Bilbo Baggin's long, enthralling, and extreme adventure with the great wizard, Gandolf, and his thirteen dwarves, will make you want to read more and more. You might even finish the book in a day or two.

Toss in a little natural philosophy (sciences) and you have the making of a monster. Or at least a being that after being spurned for looking ugly becomes ugly. So for revenge the creature decides unless Victor makes another (female this time) creature, that Victor will also suffer the loss of friends and relatives. What is victor to do? Bow to the wishes and needs of his creation? Or challenge it to the death? What would you do?Although the concept of the monster is good, and the conflicts of the story well thought out, Shelly suffers from the writing style of the time. Many people do not finish the book as the language is stilted and verbose for example when was the last time you said, \"Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy of death.\"Much of the book seems like travel log filler. More time describing the surroundings of Europe than the reason for traveling or just traveling. Many writers use traveling to reflect time passing or the character growing in stature or knowledge. In this story they just travel a lot.This book is definitely worth plodding through for moviegoers. The record needs to be set strait.

Toss in a little natural philosophy (sciences) and you have the making of a monster. Or at least a being that after being spurned for looking ugly becomes ugly. So for revenge the creature decides unless Victor makes another (female this time) creature, that Victor will also suffer the loss of friends and relatives. What is victor to do? Bow to the wishes and needs of his creation? Or challenge it to the death? What would you do?Although the concept of the monster is good, and the conflicts of the story well thought out, Shelly suffers from the writing style of the time. Many people do not finish the book as the language is stilted and verbose for example when was the last time you said, \"Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy of death.\"Much of the book seems like travel log filler. More time describing the surroundings of Europe than the reason for traveling or just traveling. Many writers use traveling to reflect time passing or the character growing in stature or knowledge. In this story they just travel a lot.This book is definitely worth plodding through for moviegoers. The record needs to be set strait.

They will even forgive his past indiscretions.Be sure to watch the three different movies made from this book:1984 (1954) Peter Cushing is Winston Smith1984 (1956) Edmond O'Brien is Winston SmithNineteen Eighty-Four (1984) John Hurt is Winston Smith                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

(For actual content, read Amazon's description above. For my bent on the series, read on.)There are basically three main theories concerning Christ's return, based off scripture, and though I won't get into them here, this one is off the pre-tribulation theory. (Which is actually the same one I believe in.) The problem is, I know why I believe in this particular theory, whereas other Christian may simply read this book and say, \"Oh, so that's what's going to happen!\" Well, before you do that, check your Bible and other sources, and don't just base it off these books. OK, time to step off my soapbox...As far as writing talent, I have been VERY disappointed with all the books in this series. At first, I gave them the benefit of the doubt, thinking the writing was so simplistic so younger kids could read them too, until I discovered they have a young kids version out for this series, at which point I was just saddened. So don't expect a well-written novel, as I feel each book's writing has become more and more simple with each release. And by this, I don't mean the story doesn't flow, because it does. It's just written in such simply words that even a grade-schooler could read it without any problems.As far as content, you'll find stuff in here you like, I don't doubt that, but if you're like me, you'll be skimming many areas because you don't care about every single step that every single person takes to get from point A to point B. It's a tedious read at parts, but if you like the study of the end times, as do I, or like reading Christian novels, as do I, then these books will suffice. But don't base your belief system off them until you know more than just what's presented here, and certainly DON'T read them if literary content is your main goal as you won't find well-WRITTEN novels here. If it weren't for that fact alone, I'd be devouring these books as they came out, but as it is, I've read them after friends buy them and are done with them since I am interested in the story, but not the work it takes for me to constantly forgive the writing.|I am going to put the same review on each of the \"Left Behind\" series books because my reaction to each of them is basically the same.

If you are perusing these reviews under Moby Dick in an effort to see whether or not it is worth reading (which is why I personally scan these reviews) let me just say emphatically that it is. But... I would suggest that you not pick this book up lightly. It is a very stubborn work that in many ways is a precursor to the 20th century's flirtation with high literature. In many ways this book can be compared to the more stubborn works of Pynchon and Joyce in that you can read it over and over again and find an entirely new perspective in which to appreciate it every time.I picked Moby Dick up several times only to be frustrated with its seemingly antiquated cadence and structure. Luckily for myself I found a reading group a few years back that was delving into some classics and Moby Dick happened to be one of these works. It made all of the difference in the world to have a knowledgeable leader of a reading group opening up discussions after every few chapters to discuss what we had read. After undergoing this experience and finishing the book I was and still am in awe of the majesty Melville attained in these pages.Please, even if you are sure of yourself as a reader and scoff at my suggestion to use a reading group or class structure to enjoy this work, find a copy that will have a comprehensive `readers guide' in order to cast light on some of the complex and arcane references. This will be helpful if only to note how uniquely Melville manipulates the focus of his story and the characters contained with in.Enjoy this book, and please don't open its pages on a whim unless you have plenty of free time, patience, and a curiosity to uncover ideas or meanings that might not be so apparent at a first reading.------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |I just wanted to put in my two cents here. If you are perusing these reviews under Moby Dick in an effort to see whether or not it is worth reading (which is why I personally scan these reviews) let me just say emphatically that it is. But... I would suggest that you not pick this book up lightly. It is a very stubborn work that in many ways is a precursor to the 20th century's flirtation with high literature.

It felt weird to see the newspapers and politics paralleling the book.I was in New York (West Point) at the time and three things stood out to this day. This was a public service announcement on the TV \"The law says that an apartment owner can not charge more than 30% of what you make\" and at the same time, the apartment buildings were closing down. The postal carriers went on strike and the military had to deliver the mail. That winter the snowplow drivers went on strike. When the strike was over the snowplows were missing. They found them the next summer in an empty lot.There is nothing quite as convincing as watching the world and book parallel each other. I have mellowed out some lately.

I was bored as I read it, and kept waiting for more to happen. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties.

This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties.

Lennie and George have each others.This book is wonderful and at the same time sad.I recommand this book because it exlains the value of friendship ,how the migrant workers are lonely,how they live and what their dreams are.In this book i love the innocent Lennie as well as George who did his best to protect his only and best friend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

At the time, I was working as an apprentice at a winery on the Rhine River. There was an old medeival castle across the river from our room. It was the perfect setting, as we two were the only English speaking people in the town. I think now is the right time to review the book, because I can only recall the feelings left behind by this powerful work of literature. Most of the plot and many of the characters have been long forgotten, leaving only the residue of strong emotion. I have read many works of powerful fiction by the world's great authors since then. But not one of them affected me emotionally the way this extraordinary tale did. I remember one gray German morning finishing the chapter where Heathcliff digs up the body of his beloved Catherine because he has gone mad in his desire to hold her close once more. And then off to the Altenkirch Schwanenkellerei I went. I spent the rest of the day working quietly in the cellars of the winery, deep inside the mountain with mold hanging all about, and brooding over the maniacal behavior of these highly romantic, insane characters. I've never been able to shake the feeling entirely. There is something so entirely timeless about this work, as though it were a piece of ancient literature, old far beyond the 1840s setting, something so utterly classical and piercingly primordial, it's as though you already had the genesis of this material in your DNA and it only required this story to bring it back to life within you. You recognize the spell it weaves because it speaks to the humanity in you so clearly, it is as though you have been secretly drugged. The English language has rarely been utilized as well as it has here, and I dare say you would need to go back to Shakespeare to find its parallel. Romanticism reached its high water mark with this novel. Ms. Bront has now become immortal because of her creation, and in the Pantheon of world literaure, she stands among the Titans. If you are a native speaker of the English language, you can hardly consider yourself educated if you have not read this astounding novel of romantic love and uncontrollable passion.                           |I read this book aloud to my wife 23 years ago.

I am glad I read it and finished it. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties.

This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel.

Even though there seems to be plenty of examples, the books short fall is on explanations (i.e. how to get from one step to the next). This textbook also seems to make many assumptions about what the student may or may not know about prerequisite material.

I was bored as I read it, and kept waiting for more to happen. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |The book was good and showed love as it is rarely seen. .

Finally he helps Bob Cratchit by raising his salary so that Tiny Tim may survive.I think this book is great for the family and though it is a little difficult I think it is suited for anyone over 12 years old.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift!

These books are very colorful, with lots of illustrations and photos of genuine artifacts, maps, and people from the era in which the story is set. Side panel text gives background information about the author, pictures and story. These \"additions\" (which do not detract from, but only enhance the story) help the young reader (and the adult too!) put the story into context.

These books are very colorful, with lots of illustrations and photos of genuine artifacts, maps, and people from the era in which the story is set. Side panel text gives background information about the author, pictures and story. These \"additions\" (which do not detract from, but only enhance the story) help the young reader (and the adult too!) put the story into context.

I am glad I read it and finished it. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |I found this book to be a disapointment to me.

I am glad I read it and finished it. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |The book was good and showed love as it is rarely seen. .

There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the Signet, Bantam, Berkley, and Black Dog & Leventhal editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them.

It would certainly be worth the $1.99 list price, but free is even better.If you've read any of Dumas' other novels you'll probably like this one. It begins rather slowly and without drama but the intensity quickly builds as does the intrigue and violence. Writing reviews about mysteries is challenging because I don't want to give too much away but I do want to encourage fans of Dumas' other works, Edgar Allan Poe's short stories, and those who just enjoy period literature to read this book because it really is a good one.The characters are lively and there is even a strong secondary female character. Dumas' writing, while not overly emotional in and of itself, definitely provokes emotion in defense of his strong characters. The villian is repulsive and unlikeable while the soon to be identified hero is awkwardly charming and by turns wiley.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, but in the spirit of full disclosure I was an English major that primarily dealt with British literature so perhaps that's why I enjoyed this book so much.

Now older, Bilbo is ready to leave his beloved home in the Shire, passing most of his possessions (including the Magic Ring he aquired in The Hobbit) to his nephew Frodo. Gandolf, the wizzard, has doubts about the Ring that are soon proven correct and a great quest is set before the young Hobbit and his group of friends.This is an epic tale, with many story lines running concurrently.

Maybe I was expecting too much, something grander along the line of the Dune series. But the book in of itself is an extreme disappointment. I realize Asimov was young (21) when he wrote this, but his style leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take an early Arthur C. Clarke book over Asimov any day. This is the first book by Asimov I've read and I'm not sure I want to read another. His style is very dialogue driven with very few, if any, detail given to what the characters think. Everyone is very two-dimensional. And he never describes any of the scenes were all of this dialog takes place. Part of the interest in science-fiction is exploring new places, seeing different things. This entire story could have taken place on an empty stage. In fact, it seems like it's written more for a play than a novel. As for the story, it starts out interestingly enough. The Empire is going to crumble and to avoid thousands of years of dark-ages, a Foundation is set up to preserve the past learning's of the Empire. Well, that's what the original thought was at least. Soon we discover there's an alternate motive to this. Once we learn of this motive, the story goes straight downhill. Asimov skips decades from one page to another. Characters are introduced that we know practically nothing about, and he never tells us anything about them. I've read history books that had more character development than he gives the people in this book. By the time I got to the end I found myself saying \"So what\"? Am I supposed to continue on reading this series because it's been called a \"classic\". I've seen the word \"classic\" thrown around a little too much sometimes.

If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift!

For this alone, the trudge was worth it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

If it is meant to be it will live through anything. .. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |This was certainly different than any other book I have ever read, and I found it interesting.

You might even finish the book in a day or two. As Gandolf and the dwarves persuade him to come with him to fight the evil dragon, Smog, and take back the gold that was once all of theirs, they are about to encounter the most exiting part of their lives.Every page of this book is a dose of excitement and action. The great part about the book is that the rising action keeps building and building drastically until the end. The Hobbit is a must read for all fantasy lovers.

His brilliance shines through in the recreation of Rivendell and the warm feel of Hobbiton. As a life-long fan of the Lord of the Rings, I have never been disappointed by Lee's interpretation of a scene or character. His artistic skill hits the mark dead center every time on every concept. In fact, this is one artist of a few (if not the only one) who are officially recognized by Tolkien's estate as a bard of Middle Earth. Therefore, the illustrations in this beautiful edition of a great book by the 20th century's best author are bound to appeal to you as you read it. In this book, the arguing trolls are just as I've imagined them, and the dwarves are like real people, not plump bodies with noses the size of their heads. The eagles, too, are glorious.

Toss in a little natural philosophy (sciences) and you have the making of a monster. Or at least a being that after being spurned for looking ugly becomes ugly. So for revenge the creature decides unless Victor makes another (female this time) creature, that Victor will also suffer the loss of friends and relatives. What is victor to do? Bow to the wishes and needs of his creation? Or challenge it to the death? What would you do?Although the concept of the monster is good, and the conflicts of the story well thought out, Shelly suffers from the writing style of the time. Many people do not finish the book as the language is stilted and verbose for example when was the last time you said, \"Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy of death.\"Much of the book seems like travel log filler. More time describing the surroundings of Europe than the reason for traveling or just traveling. Many writers use traveling to reflect time passing or the character growing in stature or knowledge. In this story they just travel a lot.This book is definitely worth plodding through for moviegoers. The record needs to be set strait. First shock is that the creator is named Victor Frankenstein; the creature is just \"monster\" not Frankenstein. And it is Victor that is backwards which added in him doing the impossible by not knowing any better. The monster is well read in \"Sorrows of a Young Werther,\" \"Paradise Lost,\" and Plutarch's \"Lives.\" The debate (mixed with a few murders) rages on as to whether the monster was doing evil because of his nature or because he was spurned?\n",

Even though it was written so long ago, the plot could be something that happened to someone today. Persuasion is about a young couple who loves each other but is persuaded to end the relationship because the girl isn't \"acceptable\" for the boy since she doesn't come from a wealthy family. They eventually meet again, and the story continues to unfold. I actually used Persuasion for the subject of one of my long papers in college, and it was so fascinating to dig into the story as well as the story behind the story. There are actually a lot of similarities between this story and Jane's own story. Jane Austen is an incredible author, and Persuasion is one of her greatest works.\n",

            "Review A: I am going to put the same review on each of the \"Left Behind\" series books because my reaction to each of them is basically the same. (For actual content, read Amazon's description above. For my bent on the series, read on.)There are basically three main theories concerning Christ's return, based off scripture, and though I won't get into them here, this one is off the pre-tribulation theory. (Which is actually the same one I believe in.) The problem is, I know why I believe in this particular theory, whereas other Christian may simply read this book and say, \"Oh, so that's what's going to happen!\" Well, before you do that, check your Bible and other sources, and don't just base it off these books. OK, time to step off my soapbox...As far as writing talent, I have been VERY disappointed with all the books in this series. At first, I gave them the benefit of the doubt, thinking the writing was so simplistic so younger kids could read them too, until I discovered they have a young kids version out for this series, at which point I was just saddened. So don't expect a well-written novel, as I feel each book's writing has become more and more simple with each release. And by this, I don't mean the story doesn't flow, because it does. It's just written in such simply words that even a grade-schooler could read it without any problems.As far as content, you'll find stuff in here you like, I don't doubt that, but if you're like me, you'll be skimming many areas because you don't care about every single step that every single person takes to get from point A to point B. It's a tedious read at parts, but if you like the study of the end times, as do I, or like reading Christian novels, as do I, then these books will suffice. But don't base your belief system off them until you know more than just what's presented here, and certainly DON'T read them if literary content is your main goal as you won't find well-WRITTEN novels here. If it weren't for that fact alone, I'd be devouring these books as they came out, but as it is, I've read them after friends buy them and are done with them since I am interested in the story, but not the work it takes for me to constantly forgive the writing.\n",

            "Review A: \"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\" by J.R.R. Tolkien is the prequel to his blockbuster hit \"Lord of the Rings\". A must read for anyone who is a LOTR fan like me. This epic fantasy introduces the world of hobbits in Middle-Earth and one in particular Bilbo Baggins of the Shire. Bilbo lives comfortably on six meals a day in his hobbit hole under the hill in Bag-End. Not one to consider himself adventurous Bilbo with the nudging of his friend the Wizard Gandalf the Grey accompanies thirteen dwarves (Thorin, Balin, Dwalin, Kili, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur and Bombur) on a quest to reclaim their lost treasure from the dragon Smaug in the Lonely Mountain. Known as the Burglar Bilbo encounters many strange creatures including pony eating goblins, wargs, wolves, giant eagles, wood elves, man eating spiders, a talking dragon and Gollum.While lost in the Misty Mountains, Bilbo finds a golden ring. To hearing the cries of the creature Gollum he puts the ring in his pocket. Gollum has lost his precious (the ring). Upon meeting, Bilbo and Gollum strike a deal. They will play a riddling game. If Bilbo wins, Gollum will lead him out of the mountains. If Gollum wins, he gets to eat Bilbo. Although Bilbo wins, Gollum has no intention of helping Bilbo when suddenly the ring finds its way to Bilbo's hand and puff...he disappears. He becomes invisible. Bilbo uses this ability to escape the Misty Mountains with its goblins and many other pickles he will find himself in throughout the rest of his adventure to Mirkwood, Lake-town and the Lonely Mountain.Although this is a fantasy novel, it is not necessarily appropriate for small children. It is more for adults, teenagers and older children.\n",

            "Review A: I just wanted to put in my two cents here. If you are perusing these reviews under Moby Dick in an effort to see whether or not it is worth reading (which is why I personally scan these reviews) let me just say emphatically that it is. But... I would suggest that you not pick this book up lightly. It is a very stubborn work that in many ways is a precursor to the 20th century's flirtation with high literature. In many ways this book can be compared to the more stubborn works of Pynchon and Joyce in that you can read it over and over again and find an entirely new perspective in which to appreciate it every time.I picked Moby Dick up several times only to be frustrated with its seemingly antiquated cadence and structure. Luckily for myself I found a reading group a few years back that was delving into some classics and Moby Dick happened to be one of these works. It made all of the difference in the world to have a knowledgeable leader of a reading group opening up discussions after every few chapters to discuss what we had read. After undergoing this experience and finishing the book I was and still am in awe of the majesty Melville attained in these pages.Please, even if you are sure of yourself as a reader and scoff at my suggestion to use a reading group or class structure to enjoy this work, find a copy that will have a comprehensive `readers guide' in order to cast light on some of the complex and arcane references. This will be helpful if only to note how uniquely Melville manipulates the focus of his story and the characters contained with in.Enjoy this book, and please don't open its pages on a whim unless you have plenty of free time, patience, and a curiosity to uncover ideas or meanings that might not be so apparent at a first reading.------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

            "Review A: In case this is your first encounter with this book, It is a fresh story but a continuation to Ayn Rand's philosophy that started out with books like \"We the living\" where she new something was wrong but could not put her finger on it. She progressed to books as \"The Fountainhead\" where she could describe the problem quite well. Now in \"Atlas Shrugged she has come up with a plausible answer to the problem. In essence, your head can work without your hands yet your hands cannot work without your head.The story is not unique but it still holds you attention. The world is becoming more socialized and it is harder for individuals to make an impact without having a multitude of parasites on their back. Some chose to fight, others chose to ignore; some do not have a clue as to what is happening. The world seems to be gearing down is just coincidence or is there some one taking a hand in it. \"Who is John Galt?\"I can tell you of my experience with the book. I must have been a late bloomer or just unlucky, because I did not come across \"Atlas shrugged\" until I was 20 years old. I was in the military and needed some reading material. My younger sister sent me the book. It looks just a little thick to me but I started reading, and reading and reading. I do not know if it was the story or the clarity of thought. Now I saw everything in a new or different light. It felt weird to see the newspapers and politics paralleling the book.I was in New York (West Point) at the time and three things stood out to this day. This was a public service announcement on the TV \"The law says that an apartment owner can not charge more than 30% of what you make\" and at the same time, the apartment buildings were closing down. The postal carriers went on strike and the military had to deliver the mail. That winter the snowplow drivers went on strike. When the strike was over the snowplows were missing. They found them the next summer in an empty lot.There is nothing quite as convincing as watching the world and book parallel each other. I have mellowed out some lately. However, I really think that this book should be read by high school age where it would have maximum impact of one's train of thought.\n",

            "Review A: I found this book to be a disapointment to me. I was bored as I read it, and kept waiting for more to happen. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.\n",

The truth is though that these are the most tacky and tasteless editions I've seen and the print and paper quality of both books is very poor. The colouring of the drawings in The Hobbit is a disgrace and numerous pages in my copy of the LOTR were so smudged they were unreadable.Don't buy them if you haven't already and if you've already made the mistake send them back with a complaint and write a scathing review to try and save someone else the trouble.\n",

The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.\n",

            "Review A: I read this book aloud to my wife 23 years ago. At the time, I was working as an apprentice at a winery on the Rhine River. There was an old medeival castle across the river from our room. It was the perfect setting, as we two were the only English speaking people in the town. I think now is the right time to review the book, because I can only recall the feelings left behind by this powerful work of literature. Most of the plot and many of the characters have been long forgotten, leaving only the residue of strong emotion. I have read many works of powerful fiction by the world's great authors since then. But not one of them affected me emotionally the way this extraordinary tale did. I remember one gray German morning finishing the chapter where Heathcliff digs up the body of his beloved Catherine because he has gone mad in his desire to hold her close once more. And then off to the Altenkirch Schwanenkellerei I went. I spent the rest of the day working quietly in the cellars of the winery, deep inside the mountain with mold hanging all about, and brooding over the maniacal behavior of these highly romantic, insane characters. I've never been able to shake the feeling entirely. There is something so entirely timeless about this work, as though it were a piece of ancient literature, old far beyond the 1840s setting, something so utterly classical and piercingly primordial, it's as though you already had the genesis of this material in your DNA and it only required this story to bring it back to life within you. You recognize the spell it weaves because it speaks to the humanity in you so clearly, it is as though you have been secretly drugged. The English language has rarely been utilized as well as it has here, and I dare say you would need to go back to Shakespeare to find its parallel. Romanticism reached its high water mark with this novel. Ms. Bront has now become immortal because of her creation, and in the Pantheon of world literaure, she stands among the Titans. If you are a native speaker of the English language, you can hardly consider yourself educated if you have not read this astounding novel of romantic love and uncontrollable passion.\n",

            "Review A: I thought this was a good book, but hard to keep interested in for long periods of time. I am glad I read it and finished it. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.\n",

The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.\n",

            "Review A: Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel.\n",

It reads like teenager's act and speak in today's schools and in society. The arrogant \"I know everything\" attitude is masterfully detailed by Salinger. The sex, alcohol, and \"don't give a damn\" attitude of Holden is really the reality of just about every teenager, even today. That is what makes Salinger's book a classic. Holden is someone we either were or someone we knew at some point in our lives. We ALL sympathize with Holden, yet at the same time we say to ourselves, \"what the hell is this kid thinking?\" Yet, we all know exactly what he is thinking, even if we don't like to admit it! If you open your mind and your heart to Holden Caulfield, you are really opening up to what went on in yourself as a teenager and what is going on in the mind of your teenagers! Caulfield reminds me of the character, Joe Green, a troubled soul on a quest to understand his past in Steiger's new master piece, Alien Rapture. I highly endorse buying this book.

You actually hear the cannons, and smell the rotting flesh of the wounded. Yet, the main plot does not take place amongst the gunfire outside. But, rather, within. It is a story of a soul, and his struggle with God, man, who he is, and what he stands for. Amidst the shouting, crying, blasting, and dieing...is a poor heart, searching for peace. I found Cornwell's protrayal of Nate Starbuck to be no less than perfect. I found myself rooting, questioning, hoping, and praying for this fictional character. For, I saw myself in Nate. The same questions, fears, and desires. When done, I walked away from this story with a different outlook on life, liberty, and what's truly important. As will you.\n",

            "Review A: Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is an attractive book about two men named George and Lennie. It is also interesting to read because it talks about how George and Lennie develop a common friendship among each other. George is short and takes care of Lennie because Lennie has a mind of a child. They both use to work in a weed but they had to leave because of an incident that had occured. They went to a new weed in Solidad where there they had many dreams ahead. In the new weed they met new people which made George and Lennie Friendships grow even more. For example Lennie has been in a fight with curley; George told him to fight back and so he did which, led Lennie to breaking Curley's hand.Even though the ending is sad, George and Lennie friendship can insipires everyone because they look out for each other.Even though Lennie is a big and huge he is a kind person.This is an excellent book written by John Steinbeck with a sad ending. Through out the pages you can see how much George cares about Lennie. I enjoyed reading this book and it has inspired me to have stronger friendship with my friends. Therefore I would like to recommend this book to those whom are interested in reading books about friendships.\n",

            "Review A: I found this book to be a disapointment to me. I was bored as I read it, and kept waiting for more to happen. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.\n",

He is helped by a long dead friend, Jacob Marley, who wishes to save Scrooge of a eternal fate of walking the Earth forever with the weight of his sins upon him. Jacob changes Scrooge by having him haunted by three ghosts who show him all the people he has hurt and all the people he will hurt if he does not change.After the spirits visit Scrooge he rewards the Cratchit family with an anonymously sent Goose and immediately finds a charity, to which he generously donates. He also makes amends with his nephew Fred that has been trying to change Scrooge for years. Finally he helps Bob Cratchit by raising his salary so that Tiny Tim may survive.I think this book is great for the family and though it is a little difficult I think it is suited for anyone over 12 years old.\n",

            "Review A: I thought this was a great book, years ago, and it still is, but I think it is outdarted for those living today and this modern world. There are so many new, contemporary novles. If you want to another read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.\n",

These books are very colorful, with lots of illustrations and photos of genuine artifacts, maps, and people from the era in which the story is set. Side panel text gives background information about the author, pictures and story. These \"additions\" (which do not detract from, but only enhance the story) help the young reader (and the adult too!) put the story into context. It is like getting both a classic and a pictorial history book rolled into one! The text is easy to read. My daughter is now 9, and reading the books on her own. Not only has she developed an appreciation for classic literature, but for history as well. These are great books for parents to read with their children. I highly recommend them!\n",

If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.\n",

            "Review A: I would recommend buying this book *now* while it's still free. It would certainly be worth the $1.99 list price, but free is even better.If you've read any of Dumas' other novels you'll probably like this one. It begins rather slowly and without drama but the intensity quickly builds as does the intrigue and violence. Writing reviews about mysteries is challenging because I don't want to give too much away but I do want to encourage fans of Dumas' other works, Edgar Allan Poe's short stories, and those who just enjoy period literature to read this book because it really is a good one.The characters are lively and there is even a strong secondary female character. Dumas' writing, while not overly emotional in and of itself, definitely provokes emotion in defense of his strong characters. The villian is repulsive and unlikeable while the soon to be identified hero is awkwardly charming and by turns wiley.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, but in the spirit of full disclosure I was an English major that primarily dealt with British literature so perhaps that's why I enjoyed this book so much. For non-English majors this book might be too stilted or old timey but for anyone who enjoys mysteries, suspense, or gardening this book is a great freebie to download.\n",

            "Review A: \"The Lord of the Rings\" is the sequel to J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy classic,The Hobbit. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first book of three (followed byThe Two Towers: Being the Second Part of The Lord of the Rings,The Return of the King: Being the Third Part of The Lord of the Rings), but it is actually one epic tale.More adult oriented concepts are included than in The Hobbit, and there are refferences to the pre-history Tolkien was developing and published in various \"Middle Earth\" books, making this a more challenging read (I always have trouble getting through the first part of The Two Towers).The story picks up some years after Bilbo Baggins returns from the adventure told in The Hobbit. Now older, Bilbo is ready to leave his beloved home in the Shire, passing most of his possessions (including the Magic Ring he aquired in The Hobbit) to his nephew Frodo. Gandolf, the wizzard, has doubts about the Ring that are soon proven correct and a great quest is set before the young Hobbit and his group of friends.This is an epic tale, with many story lines running concurrently. This has it all, Monsters, Wizards, Battles, Treason, Love, Self Sacrifice and much more!Highly recommended!\n",

But the book in of itself is an extreme disappointment. I realize Asimov was young (21) when he wrote this, but his style leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take an early Arthur C. Clarke book over Asimov any day. This is the first book by Asimov I've read and I'm not sure I want to read another. His style is very dialogue driven with very few, if any, detail given to what the characters think. Everyone is very two-dimensional. And he never describes any of the scenes were all of this dialog takes place. Part of the interest in science-fiction is exploring new places, seeing different things. This entire story could have taken place on an empty stage. In fact, it seems like it's written more for a play than a novel. As for the story, it starts out interestingly enough. The Empire is going to crumble and to avoid thousands of years of dark-ages, a Foundation is set up to preserve the past learning's of the Empire. Well, that's what the original thought was at least. Soon we discover there's an alternate motive to this. Once we learn of this motive, the story goes straight downhill. Asimov skips decades from one page to another. Characters are introduced that we know practically nothing about, and he never tells us anything about them. I've read history books that had more character development than he gives the people in this book. By the time I got to the end I found myself saying \"So what\"? Am I supposed to continue on reading this series because it's been called a \"classic\". I've seen the word \"classic\" thrown around a little too much sometimes. This is definitely one of those times.\n",

            "Review A: I found this book to be a disapointment to me. I was bored as I read it, and kept waiting for more to happen. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.\n",

If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.\n",

The author himself over-egged the pudding somewhat by inserting far too many personal observations,which bordered at times on pomposity, seemingly to try to point the reader in the direction he/she is meant to think. But amongst it there was a nugget of truth, which shone above all else, and really is the essence of the story - \"Though you...never see him again, or forget his very name, (he) will work in your thoughts till you die. It isn't possible to love and to part. You will wish that it was. You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you. I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal.\" (p.223 Penguin Classics, London:2000). For this alone, the trudge was worth it.\n",

            "Review A: I thought this was a good book, but hard to keep interested in for long periods of time. I am glad I read it and finished it. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.\n",

A chapter is spent on Egyptian social classes, ranging from the Pharaoh to the peasantry to slaves, a delightful bite of information concerning Deir el-Medina hidden within. However, I must confess that one of the greatest pleasures came to me when I found among the wonderful plates a long sought after photo of the author, standing in the temple of Seti I at abydos; I like to have faces to go along with my favorite Egyptological authors. I also send my admonitions to Aidon Dodson for a wonderful job of updating; he made the book current without undermining Cyril's style, and nowhere can you for certain know something has been changed.\n",

There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the Bantam, Berkley, and Black Dog & Leventhal editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them. Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed.\n",

            "Review A: I found this book to be a disapointment to me. I was bored as I read it, and kept waiting for more to happen. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever.\n",

            "  This  book  is  one  of  the  most  meaningful  of  all  time  and  one  I  think  should  be  read  more  often  than  just  watched  on  television  during  the  Christmas  season.  It  is  a  tale  of  a  small,  cruel,  and  heartless  man  changing  into  a  kind  and  generous  soul.  He  is  helped  by  a  long  dead  friend,  Jacob  Marley,  who  wishes  to  save  Scrooge  of  a  eternal  fate  of  walking  the  Earth  forever  with  the  weight  of  his  sins  upon  him.  Jacob  changes  Scrooge  by  having  him  haunted  by  three  ghosts  who  show  him  all  the  people  he  has  hurt  and  all  the  people  he  will  hurt  if  he  does  not  change.After  the\u001b[91m- spirits\u001b[0m?     -\n",

These  books  are  very  colorful,  with  lots  of  illustrations  and  photos  of  genuine  artifacts,  maps,  and  people  from  the  era  in  which  the  story  is  set.  Side  panel  text  gives  background  information  about  the  author,  pictures  and  story.  These  \"additions\"  (which  do  not  detract  from,  but  only  enhance  the  story)  help  the  young  reader  (and  the  adult  too!)  put  the  story  into  context.  It  is  like  getting  both  a  classic  and  a  pictorial  history  book  rolled  into  one!  The  text  is  easy  to  read.  My  daughter  is  now  9,  and  reading  the  books  on  her  own.  Not  only  has  she  developed  an  appreciation  for  classic  literature,  but  for  history  as  well.  These  are  great  books  for  parents  to  read  with  their  children.  I  highly  recommend  them!\n",

            "  I  am  going  to  put  the  same  review  on  each  of  the  \"Left  Behind\"  series  books  because  my  reaction  to  each  of  them  is  basically  the  same.  (For  actual  content,  read  Amazon's  description  above.  For  my  bent  on  the  series,  read  on.)There  are  basically  three  main  theories  concerning  Christ's  return,  based  off  scripture,  and  though  I  won't  get  into  them  here,  this  one  is  off  the  pre-tribulation  theory.  (Which  is  actually  the  same  one  I  believe  in.)  The  problem  is,  I  know  why  I  believe  in  this  particular  theory,  whereas  other  Christian  may  simply  read  this  book  and  say,  \"Oh,  so  that's  what's  going  to  happen!\"  Well,  before  you  do  that,  check  your  Bible  and  other  sources,  and  don't  just  base  it  off  these  books.  OK,  time  to  step  off  my  soapbox...As  far  as  writing  talent,  I  have  been  VERY  disappointed  with  all  the  books  in  this  series.  At  first,  I  gave  them  the  benefit  of  the  doubt,  thinking  the  writing  was  so  simplistic  so  younger  kids  could  read  them  too,  until  I  discovered  they  have  a  young  kids  version  out  for  this  series,  at  which  point  I  was  just  saddened.  So  don't  expect  a  well-written  novel,  as  I  feel  each  book's  writing  has  become  more  and  more  simple  with  each  release.  And  by  this,  I  don't  mean  the  story  doesn't  flow,  because  it  does.  It's  just  written  in  such  simply  words  that  even  a  grade-schooler  could  read  it  without  any  problems.As  far  as  content,  you'll  find  stuff  in  here  you  like,  I  don't  doubt  that,  but  if  you're  like  me,  you'll  be  skimming  many  areas  because  you  don't  care  about  every  single  step  that  every  single  person  takes  to  get  from  point  A  to  point  B.  It's  a  tedious  read  at  parts,  but  if  you  like  the  study  of  the  end  times,  as  do  I,  or  like  reading  Christian  novels,  as  do  I,  then  these  books  will  suffice.  But  don't  base  your  belief  system  off  them  until  you  know  more  than  just  what's  presented  here,  and  certainly  DON'T  read  them  if  literary  content  is  your  main  goal  as  you  won't  find  well-WRITTEN  novels  here.  If  it  weren't  for  that  fact  alone,  I'd  be  devouring  these  books  as  they  came  out,  but  as  it  is,  I've  read  them  after  friends  buy  them  and  are  done  with  them  since  I  am  interested  in  the  story,  but  not  the  work  it  takes  for  me  to  constantly  forgive  the\u001b[91m- writing.\u001b[0m\u001b[92m+ writing.FYI,\u001b[0m?         ++++\n",

Cornwell  takes  you  from  your  reading  room,  and  teleports  you  back  to  a  simpler  time.  And  you  find  out  that  it's  not  so  simple.  Set  against  the  backdrop  of  the  Eastern  Theatre  in  the  American  Civil  War,  he  portrays  the  massive  carnage  and  greatest  bravery  in  minute  detail.  You  actually  hear  the  cannons,  and  smell  the  rotting  flesh  of  the  wounded.  Yet,  the  main  plot  does  not  take  place  amongst  the  gunfire  outside.  But,  rather,  within.  It  is  a  story  of  a  soul,  and  his  struggle  with  God,  man,  who  he  is,  and  what  he  stands  for.  Amidst  the  shouting,  crying,  blasting,  and  dieing...is  a  poor  heart,  searching  for  peace.  I  found  Cornwell's  protrayal  of  Nate  Starbuck  to  be  no  less  than  perfect.  I  found  myself  rooting,  questioning,  hoping,  and  praying  for  this  fictional  character.  For,  I  saw  myself  in  Nate.  The  same  questions,  fears,  and  desires.  When  done,  I  walked  away  from  this  story  with  a  different  outlook  on  life,  liberty,  and  what's  truly  important.  As  will  you.\n",

            "  Emma  Woodhouse  is  an  atypical  heroine  for  a  Jane  Austen  novel.  Usually,  we  see  disadvantaged  girls  struggle  to  find  happiness  through  marriage.  In  Emma's  case,  we  see  a  girl  who  has  everything  in  the  world  she  could  want.  She  is  rich,  pretty,  and  happy.  She  has  no  desire  to  be  married,  as  it  would  interfere  with  the  simple  life  she  enjoys  with  her  father  and  she  knows  it  would  break  his  heart  to  be  parted  from  her.  The  story  follows  Emma's  life  beginning  at  21  as  she  tries  to  help  a  young  girl  named  Harriet  Smith  marry  above  her  station.  Emma  also  engages  in  a  flirtation  with  a  young  man  and  generally  makes  a\u001b[91m- bit\u001b[0m\u001b[91m- of\u001b[0m  a  mess  of  things\u001b[91m- whenever\u001b[0m\u001b[92m+ as\u001b[0m  she\u001b[91m- gets\u001b[0m\u001b[91m- involved.I\u001b[0m\u001b[92m+ tries\u001b[0m\u001b[92m+ to\u001b[0m\u001b[92m+ manage\u001b[0m\u001b[92m+ the\u001b[0m\u001b[92m+ affairs\u001b[0m\u001b[92m+ of\u001b[0m\u001b[92m+ others.I\u001b[0m  have  read  that  Jane  Austen  felt  that  Emma  was  a  character  only  her  creator  could  like.  I  would  have  to  disagree  with  that.  Emma  is  certainly  flawed,  but  her  heart  is  almost  always  in  the  right  place.  Pride  has  blinded  her  to  her  own  limitations  but  she  is  also  one  who  does  not  shrink  from  the  responsibility  of  her  mistakes  and  tries  very  hard  to  learn  from  them.  I  found  this  admirable  and  grew  to  like  her  more  and  more  as  the  book  progressed.Aside  from  Emma,  the  rest  of  the  cast  was  also  very  well  written.  Her  father  is  a  complete  hypochondriac  and  often  engages  in  behavior  that  would  typically  be  considered  highly  rude.  Yet,  he  is  motivated  so  completely  by  a  desire  to  be  kind  to  others  that  his  misguided  application  of  that  desire  only  endears  him  to  the  reader.  Mr.  Knightley,  the  no-nonsense  friend  of  the  family  is  admittedly  not  the  most  complex  character  in  the  world,  but  he  is  a  very  good  one  and  his  solidity  is  a  great  counterbalance  to  Emma's  wishful  thinking.In  summary,  Emma  is  a  nice  change  of  pace  from  Jane  Austen's  other  novels.  It  starts  off  well  and  grows  more  engaging  as  it  continues.  The  characters  are  interesting  and  Emma  herself  grows  considerably  during  the  course  of  the  novel.\n",

Toss  in  a  little  natural  philosophy  (sciences)  and  you  have  the  making  of  a  monster.  Or  at  least  a  being  that  after  being  spurned  for  looking  ugly  becomes  ugly.  So  for  revenge  the  creature  decides  unless  Victor  makes  another  (female  this  time)  creature,  that  Victor  will  also  suffer  the  loss  of  friends  and  relatives.  What  is  victor  to  do?  Bow  to  the  wishes  and  needs  of  his  creation?  Or  challenge  it  to  the  death?  What  would  you  do?Although  the  concept  of  the  monster  is  good,  and  the  conflicts  of  the  story  well  thought  out,  Shelly  suffers  from  the  writing  style  of  the  time.

Many  writers  use  traveling  to  reflect  time  passing  or  the  character  growing  in  stature  or  knowledge.  In  this  story  they  just  travel  a  lot.This  book  is  definitely  worth  plodding  through  for  moviegoers.  The  record  needs  to  be  set  strait.  First  shock  is  that  the  creator  is  named  Victor  Frankenstein;  the  creature  is  just  \"monster\"  not  Frankenstein.  And  it  is  Victor  that  is  backwards  which  added  in  him  doing  the  impossible  by  not  knowing  any  better.  The  monster  is  well  read  in  \"Sorrows  of  a  Young  Werther,\"  \"Paradise  Lost,\"  and  Plutarch's  \"Lives.\"  The  debate  (mixed  with  a  few  murders)  rages  on  as  to  whether  the  monster  was  doing  evil  because  of  his  nature  or  because  he  was\u001b[91m- spurned?\u001b[0m\u001b[92m+ spurned?The\u001b[0m?         +++\n",

            "  It  is  well  written.  The  idea  of  a  storyteller  in  the  story  is  not  unique  but  very  effective.  We  could  ponder  over  the  word  darkness  for  quite  some  time.  The  best  way  to  ponder  is  with  Cliff's  Notes.  Personally  I  wanted  him  to  get  on  with  it.  I  guess  I  was  a  little  impatient  for  the  action  and  the  conclusion.  If  it  hadn't  been  for  cliff  notes  I  would  have  missed  haft  the  things  he  was  implying.A  merchant  company  is  missing  an  agent  Kurtz,  and  Marlowe  must  find  him.  Traveling  though  harsher  environments  than  he  imagined  possible  he  may  have  found  what  he  was  seeking.  As  with  many  of  this  type  of  epic  the  physical  distance  or  direction  is  not  as  important  then  the  transformation  it  plays  on  ones  soul.I  missed  this  book  somehow  in  school.

            "  I  just  wanted  to  put  in  my  two  cents  here.  If  you  are  perusing  these  reviews  under  Moby  Dick  in  an  effort  to  see  whether  or  not  it  is  worth  reading  (which  is  why  I  personally  scan  these  reviews)  let  me  just  say  emphatically  that  it  is.  But...  I  would  suggest  that  you  not  pick  this  book  up  lightly.  It  is  a  very  stubborn  work  that  in  many  ways  is  a  precursor  to  the  20th  century's  flirtation  with  high  literature.  In  many  ways  this  book  can  be  compared  to  the  more  stubborn  works  of  Pynchon  and  Joyce  in  that  you  can  read  it  over  and  over  again  and  find  an  entirely  new  perspective  in  which  to  appreciate  it  every  time.I  picked  Moby  Dick  up  several  times  only  to  be  frustrated  with  its  seemingly  antiquated  cadence  and  structure.  Luckily  for  myself  I  found  a  reading  group  a  few  years  back  that  was  delving  into  some  classics  and  Moby  Dick  happened  to  be  one  of  these  works.  It  made  all  of  the  difference  in  the  world  to  have  a  knowledgeable  leader  of  a  reading  group  opening  up  discussions  after  every  few  chapters  to  discuss  what  we  had  read.  After  undergoing  this  experience  and  finishing  the  book  I  was  and  still  am  in  awe  of  the  majesty  Melville  attained  in  these  pages.Please,  even  if  you  are  sure  of  yourself  as  a  reader  and  scoff  at  my  suggestion  to  use  a  reading  group  or  class  structure  to  enjoy  this  work,  find  a  copy  that  will  have  a  comprehensive  `readers  guide'  in  order  to  cast  light  on  some  of  the  complex  and  arcane  references.  This  will  be  helpful  if  only  to  note  how  uniquely  Melville  manipulates  the  focus  of  his  story  and  the  characters  contained  with  in.Enjoy  this  book,  and\u001b[91m- please\u001b[0m  don't  open  its  pages  on  a  whim  unless  you  have  plenty  of  free  time,  patience,  and  a  curiosity  to  uncover  ideas  or  meanings  that  might  not  be  so  apparent  at  a  first\u001b[91m- reading.------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m\u001b[92m+ reading.\u001b[0m\n",

            "  Persuasion  is  a  fantastic  novel  by  Jane  Austen.  I've  read  all  of  her  works,  and  this  is  one  of  my  absolute  favorites.  Even  though  it  was  written  so  long  ago,  the  plot  could  be  something  that  happened  to  someone  today.  Persuasion  is  about  a  young  couple  who  loves  each  other  but  is  persuaded  to  end  the  relationship  because  the  girl  isn't  \"acceptable\"  for  the  boy  since  she  doesn't  come  from  a  wealthy  family.  They  eventually  meet  again,  and  the  story  continues  to  unfold.  I  actually  used  Persuasion  for  the  subject  of  one  of  my  long  papers  in  college,  and  it  was  so  fascinating  to  dig  into  the  story  as  well  as  the  story  behind  the  story.  There  are  actually  a  lot  of  similarities  between  this  story  and  Jane's  own  story.

            "  This  book  has  been  required  reading  in  High  Schools  for  years.  My  experience  is  that  school  actually  demotivates  people  from  wanting  to  read.  How  many  of  us  can  relate  with  the  feelings  of  never  wanting  to  read  another  book  after  high  school.  When  grades  are  the  motivation  to  read,  people  search  for  the  cliff  notes  and  or  look  for  reviews  in  Encyclopedias.  In  my  High  School  English  class,  grades  were  given  on  the  basis  of  how  many  books  one  read.  If  you  read  8-10  you  received  an  A.  The  problem  was  that  after  knowing  one  was  going  to  get  an  A,  all  reading  stopped.  Reading  is  supposed  to  be  done  for  the  joy  of  it.  I  hear  the  word  boring  used  a  great  deal  when  reviewing  a  book.  I  know  so  many  kids  who  end  up  hating  reading  because  they  received  a  poor  grade.

I  intended  to  give  the  book  a  quick  read,  but  I  got  so  caught  up  in  the  story  that  I  couldn't  put  the  book  down.  From  the  very  beginning,  I  was  fully  caught  up  in  the  heart-wrenching  account  of  Julie  Hunter's  battle  with  lupus  and  her  growing  love  for  Don  Lipton.  This  love,  in  the  face  of  Julie's  impending  death,  makes  for  a  story  that  covers  the  range  of  human  emotions.

            "  Whereas  other  reviews  have  focused  on  Tolkien's  excellent  story,  I  want  to  recommend  Alan  Lee's  fantastic  illustrations.  Lee  was  one  of  two  Tolkien  illustrators  called  by  Peter  Jackson  for  the  making  of  the  trilogy  film,  The  Lord  of  the  Rings.  His  brilliance  shines  through  in  the  recreation  of  Rivendell  and  the  warm  feel  of  Hobbiton.  As  a  life-long  fan  of  the  Lord  of  the  Rings,  I  have  never  been  disappointed  by  Lee's  interpretation  of  a  scene  or  character.  His  artistic  skill  hits  the  mark  dead  center  every  time  on  every  concept.  In  fact,\u001b[91m- this\u001b[0m? -\n",

Therefore,  the  illustrations  in  this  beautiful  edition  of  a  great  book  by  the  20th  century's  best  author  are  bound  to  appeal  to  you  as  you  read  it.  In  this  book,  the  arguing  trolls  are  just  as  I've  imagined  them,  and  the  dwarves  are  like  real  people,  not  plump  bodies  with  noses  the  size  of  their  heads.  The  eagles,  too,  are  glorious.  I  heartily  recommend  this  edition  of  Tolkien's  wonderful  fantasy!\n",

            "  In  a  mythical  or  maybe  just  forgotten  time,  many  creatures  lived  in  places  like  the  Shire,  home  to  Bilbo  Baggins,  Hobbit.  Hobbits  are  comfort  loving  creatures  with  no  real  sense  for  adventure.  A  knock  on  the  door  and  Bilbo's  life  is  about  to  change.Calling  this  book  children's  book  is  like  calling  \"Alice  in  Wonderland\"  [see  \"The  Annotated  Alice\"]  a  children's  book.  Yes  children  can  read  this  book  and  it  is  fun.  How  ever  there  is  a  lot  more  to  this  book  than  a  cute  story.  And  it  has  all  the  depth  of  the  other  Tolkien  works  with  the  exception  of  being  shorter.Many  people  look  at  this  story  as  a  prequel  to  \"The  Lord  of  the  Rings\",  where  in  reality  it  is  a  stand-alone  story  with  a  perfectly  good  beginning,  middle,  and  end.  When  you  read  \"The  Lord  of  the  Rings\"  there  is  enough  description  to  forgo  \"The  Hobbit.\"  Personally,  I  find  that  reading  The  Lord  of  the  Rings  first  gave  me  the  in-depth  background  to  better  appreciate  The  Hobbit.Many  of  the  creatures  and  adventures  will  put  you  on  the  edge  of  your  seat.  You  will  recognize  the  personalities  and  grow  along  will  Bilbo  as  he  faces  new  challenges  as  he  learns  to  deal  with  life.A  good  book  to  read  first  would  be  \"The  Power  of  Myth\"  by  Joseph  Campbell.  Then  you  get  a  clearer  picture  of  why  the  story  progresses  as  it\u001b[92m+ does.\u001b[0m\u001b[91m- does.Joseph\u001b[0m\u001b[91m- Campbell\u001b[0m\u001b[91m- and\u001b[0m\u001b[91m- the\u001b[0m\u001b[91m- Power\u001b[0m\u001b[91m- of\u001b[0m\u001b[91m- Myth\u001b[0m\n",

This  love,  in  the  face  of  Julie's  impending  death,  makes  for  a  story  that  covers  the  range  of  human  emotions.  The  touches  of  humor  are  great,  too,  they  add  some  nice  contrast  and  lighten  things  a  bit  when  emotions  are  running  high.  I've  never  read  a  book  more  deserving  of  being  published.  It  has  rare  depth.  Julie's  story  will  remind  your  readers  that  life  and  love  are  precious  and  not  to  be  taken  for  granted.  It  has  had  an  impact  on  me,  and  for  that  I'm  grateful.

From  the  very  beginning,  I  was  fully  caught  up  in  the  heart-wrenching  account  of  Julie  Hunter's  battle  with  lupus  and  her  growing  love  for  Don  Lipton.  This  love,  in  the  face  of  Julie's  impending  death,  makes  for  a  story  that  covers  the  range  of  human  emotions.  The  touches  of  humor  are  great,  too,  they  add  some  nice  contrast  and  lighten  things  a  bit  when  emotions  are  running  high.  I've  never  read  a  book  more  deserving  of  being  published.  It  has  rare  depth.

It  begins  rather  slowly  and  without  drama  but  the  intensity  quickly  builds  as  does  the  intrigue  and  violence.  Writing  reviews  about  mysteries  is  challenging  because  I  don't  want  to  give  too  much  away  but  I  do  want  to  encourage  fans  of  Dumas'  other  works,  Edgar  Allan  Poe's  short  stories,  and  those  who  just  enjoy  period  literature  to  read  this  book  because  it  really  is  a  good  one.The  characters  are  lively  and  there  is  even  a  strong  secondary  female  character.  Dumas'  writing,  while  not  overly  emotional  in  and  of  itself,  definitely  provokes  emotion  in  defense  of  his  strong  characters.  The  villian  is  repulsive  and  unlikeable  while  the  soon  to  be  identified  hero  is  awkwardly  charming  and  by  turns  wiley.I  thoroughly  enjoyed  reading  this  book,  but  in  the  spirit  of  full  disclosure  I  was  an  English  major  that  primarily  dealt  with  British  literature  so  perhaps  that's  why  I  enjoyed  this  book  so  much.  For  non-English  majors  this  book  might  be  too  stilted  or  old  timey  but  for  anyone  who  enjoys  mysteries,  suspense,  or  gardening  this  book  is  a  great\u001b[91m- freebie\u001b[0m\u001b[92m+ one\u001b[0m  to  download.\n",

This  love,  in  the  face  of  Julie's  impending  death,  makes  for  a  story  that  covers  the  range  of  human  emotions.  The  touches  of  humor  are  great,  too,  they  add  some  nice  contrast  and  lighten  things  a  bit  when  emotions  are  running  high.  I've  never  read  a  book  more  deserving  of  being  published.  It  has  rare  depth.  Julie's  story  will  remind  your  readers  that  life  and  love  are  precious  and  not  to  be  taken  for  granted.  It  has  had  an  impact  on  me,  and  for  that  I'm  grateful.

            "  I  read  this  book  aloud  to  my  wife  23  years  ago.  At  the  time,  I  was  working  as  an  apprentice  at  a  winery  on  the  Rhine  River.  There  was  an  old  medeival  castle  across  the  river  from  our  room.  It  was  the  perfect  setting,  as  we  two  were  the  only  English  speaking  people  in  the  town.  I  think  now  is  the  right  time  to  review  the  book,  because  I  can  only  recall  the  feelings  left  behind  by  this  powerful  work  of  literature.  Most  of  the  plot  and  many  of  the  characters  have  been  long  forgotten,  leaving  only  the  residue  of  strong  emotion.  I  have  read  many  works  of  powerful  fiction  by  the  world's  great  authors  since  then.  But  not  one  of  them  affected  me  emotionally  the  way  this  extraordinary  tale  did.  I  remember  one  gray  German  morning  finishing  the  chapter  where  Heathcliff  digs  up  the  body  of  his  beloved  Catherine  because  he  has  gone  mad  in  his  desire  to  hold  her  close  once  more.  And  then  off  to  the  Altenkirch  Schwanenkellerei  I  went.  I  spent  the  rest  of  the  day  working  quietly  in  the  cellars  of  the  winery,  deep  inside  the  mountain  with  mold  hanging  all  about,  and  brooding  over  the  maniacal  behavior  of  these  highly  romantic,  insane  characters.
